Mounting risks threaten survival of wild European pollinators – IUCN Red List,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/mounting-risks-threaten-survival-wild-european-pollinators-2025-10-11_en,11 October 2025,Nearly 100 additional wild bee species in Europe have been classified as threatened in a new assessment for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, 11 October 2025 (IUCN) – Nearly 100 additional wild bee species in Europe have been classified as threatened in a new assessment for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™, with more than 20% of species in groups such as bumblebees and cellophane bees now facing a risk of extinction. New IUCN Red List assessments also reveal that the number of threatened European butterfly species increased by a sharp 76% over the last decade.
Funded by the European Commission, the latest European-level assessments for the IUCN Red List re-evaluate the conservation status of a large number of species groups for the first time since the early and mid-2010s: bees, butterflies, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, freshwater fishes and molluscs, saproxylic (wood-dependent) beetles, dragonflies and damselflies.
“Beyond their beauty and cultural significance, pollinators like bees and butterflies are lifelines for our health, our food systems and our economies – sustaining the fruits, vegetables and seeds that nourish us. In fact, four out of five crop and wildflower species in the EU rely on insect pollination. The latest European Red List assessments reveal serious challenges, with threats mounting for butterflies and crucial wild bee species. Yet this knowledge is powerful: by highlighting the pressures species face, the Red List also helps us chart the path forward. It provides the data needed to drive urgent conservation action, guide recovery efforts and support European countries in delivering on the Global Biodiversity Framework targets. While the challenges are real, this work illuminates the solutions – helping us secure a thriving future for people and nature alike,” said Dr Grethel Aguilar, IUCN Director General.
“The new assessment shows that the conservation status of European wild bees, butterflies and other pollinators is dire. These are the foundation for our food systems, our ecosystems and our societies. Urgent and collective action is needed to tackle this threat. Together with Member States, the European Commission has put in place an EU-wide monitoring system for pollinators based on the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, which will help to track our progress. Now, we need to focus on implementation and cooperation with Member States to protect our pollinators,” said Jessika Roswall, EU Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience and a Competitive Circular Economy.
Growing threats to wild bees, bumblebees and butterflies
An estimated 10% of wild bees in Europe (at least 172 out of 1,928 assessed species) are at risk of extinction. That compares to 77 threatened species in 2014. At the time, 57% of wild bee species were considered Data Deficient, a percentage that has been reduced to 14% in the new assessment – making it the most comprehensive evaluation of the status of European wild bees to date.
Fifteen species of bumblebees – known for their role in pollinating legume plants like peas, beans, peanuts and clover – as well as 14 species of cellophane bees – which help pollinate plants in the daisy family and trees such as red maples and willows – are now classified as threatened. The mining bee species Simpanurgus phyllopodus, the only species of this genus in Europe and unique to the continent, is now assessed as Critically Endangered.
New Red List assessments indicate that 15% of butterflies in Europe face extinction risk (65 out of 442 assessed species), up from 37 species in 2010. Over 40% of butterflies unique to the European region and found nowhere else in the world are now threatened or close to being so. One species, the Madeiran large white (Pieris wollastoni), which was restricted to the Portuguese island of Madeira, is now officially classified as Extinct.
Intensive agriculture, pollution and rising temperatures pose main threats
Habitat loss continues to rank as the main threat to European wild bees and butterflies but now affects a greater number of species. European pollinators are largely dependent on traditional rural landscapes, particularly flower-rich meadows created by non-intensive management. Agricultural and forestry intensification, combined with land abandonment in less productive zones, is contributing to the degradation and fragmentation of habitats crucial to pollinator survival. Nitrogen deposition from fertilisers, and widespread pesticide applications, including herbicides that reduce flower diversity, are negatively impacting many pollinators such as the shiny dufourea (Dufourea minuta), a once-widespread bee species which has now almost entirely disappeared from the plains of central Europe and is classified as Endangered.
Compounding these challenges, climate change now affects 52% of threatened species of butterflies – approximately twice as many as in the previous report. Prolonged hot periods, droughts and wildfires are increasingly deteriorating butterfly habitats in southern Europe while encroaching on sensitive bog and tundra habitats in Alpine and Boreal zones. Several species, such as the Critically Endangered Nevada grayling (Pseudochazara williamsi), now restricted to a few mountain ranges in south-east Spain, suffer from a combination of habitat loss and climate change. The effects of warmer temperatures on bees are mixed. While bumblebees and other cold-adapted species groups are negatively affected, others, such as carpenter bees, are benefiting from warmer temperatures, which accelerate their development and breeding.
Dr Denis Michez, Professor at the University of Mons and lead coordinator of the European wild bees assessment, said: ""Up to 90% of flowering plants in Europe depend on animal pollination, especially on bees, which are very diverse in their number and variety of species. Sadly, wild bee populations are in drastic decline and cannot be easily replaced by managed colonies, which comprise less than 1% of the existing species and are selected for their ability to produce honey or pollinate crops. If wild bees disappear, many wild plants might be at risk too – of which flower-rich meadows and beautiful orchid species are just a few examples”.
Dr Martin Warren, former CEO of Butterfly Conservation and one of the lead coordinators of the European butterflies assessment, said: “Many European butterflies are threatened by habitat changes due to rising temperatures. However, by ensuring their habitats are managed as well as possible and populations are large and robust, they stand a chance. Others can be saved from extinction by preventing wildfires, which can obliterate habitats for years.”
The publication of the bee and butterfly assessments follows the first Europe-wide assessment of hoverflies, another crucial pollinator group. Published in 2022, it revealed that 37% of all hoverfly species in Europe are threatened with extinction.
Together, these IUCN Red List assessments make an essential contribution to the knowledge base that underpins the implementation of the EU’s New Deal for Pollinators, especially in tracking progress towards the pollinator targets under the Nature Restoration Regulation.

Energy efficiency is the most cost-effective and socially inclusive tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce the EU’s reliance on imported fossil fuels and improve resilience to energy price shocks. By lowering energy consumption, energy efficiency measures also reduce energy bills for citizens and businesses and strengthen the EU’s industrial competitiveness.
With this directive, agreed by the co-legislators on 10 March 2023 and in force since 10 October 2023, the EU sets a binding goal to achieve an overall reduction in the final energy consumption of 11.7% by 2030 (compared to 2020 projections). Delivering this target demands a concerted effort from all EU countries over the next 5 years, which is reflected in their National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs). The Commission monitors progress in this domain, notably by analysing NECPs. The Commission’s EU-wide assessment of the cumulative impact of the updated NECPs (COM/2025/274), published in May, indicated that, while many countries have raised their energy efficiency ambitions, further efforts are needed to fully meet the target.
To achieve this objective, the directive mandates that before investing in new energy infrastructure such as power plants, heating systems or grids, public authorities in EU countries check whether improvements in energy efficiency could be a cheaper and cleaner alternative. If so, energy efficient solutions must be prioritised.
Other aspects of the directive require EU countries to

"EU’s Leading Role Instrumental in advancing sustainable and inclusive science, technology, and innovation",https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/eus-leading-role-instrumental-advancing-sustainable-and-inclusive-science-technology-and-innovation-2025-10-10_en,10 October 2025,"G20 reinforces international collaboration in science, technology, and innovation (STI) as a cornerstone for addressing global challenges.","The G20 Research, Science and Innovation Ministerial Meeting took place in Tshwane, South Africa, on 23 September 2025, bringing together ministers from G20 members and invited countries to reinforce international collaboration in science, technology, and innovation (STI) as a cornerstone for addressing global challenges.
Throughout South Africa’s G20 Presidency in 2025, the European Commission has played a central and active role in shaping the work of the G20 Research and Innovation Working Group (RIWG). The Commission contributed substantively to the development and negotiation of all core deliverables and the Ministerial Tshwane Declaration, working in close coordination with the Presidency, G20 members and invited countries, and knowledge partners. This included extensive engagement in the drafting and negotiation process, providing policy and technical expertise for all deliverables, and seeking alignment of G20 RIWG priorities with EU core values and principles.
The EU’s contribution was particularly significant in advancing work on Open Innovation and science engagement, including recommendations on countering misinformation, strengthening trust in science, and enhancing access to biodiversity data. The Commission also co-led discussions on equity, inclusion, and ethical research cooperation, ensuring that these values were strongly embedded across all outputs.
Commissioner Ekaterina Zaharieva, representing the EU at the Ministerial meeting in Tshwane, reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to open, inclusive, and responsible science. She underlined the importance of translating principles into action—highlighting the EU’s initiatives on open innovation, biodiversity data sharing, closing the gender gap in STEM and science engagement as examples of EU leadership in global STI cooperation, while strongly advocating for science to be open, inclusive, and trusted.
A key outcome of the meeting was the adoption of the G20 Tshwane Package, supported by UNESCO and the OECD. The package includes important deliverables such as the G20 Recommendations on Enhancing Science Engagement, which reflect many of the EU’s longstanding policy priorities. These recommendations aim to promote openness, transparency, and public trust in science, and strengthen international cooperation in areas such as disaster risk reduction, biodiversity, and gender equality in STI.
The Commission’s sustained involvement throughout the RIWG process has ensured that the G20 STI agenda remains aligned with the EU’s strategic vision: using science and innovation to deliver sustainable, inclusive, and globally connected solutions.
The Chairs Summary report presented at the Tshwane Ministerial meeting positions open science and open innovation as essential tools for addressing global challenges and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. In this light, leaders committed to fostering collaborative research, enabling scientists to work across borders, coordinating investments in research infrastructure, and strengthening global knowledge-sharing. Additionally, they pledged to preserve and restore ecosystems and expand access to international biodiversity initiatives, including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and open-access species catalogues.
Equity and inclusion in science are central to the work of G20 science track. Leaders emphasised the importance of equal opportunities and safe workplaces free from harassment while promoting responsible, ethical, and open international research cooperation.
The Ministerial meeting also led to the adoption of the G20 Tshwane package, supported by UNESCO and the OECD, focusing on open innovation, disaster risk reduction, biodiversity data, and gender equality, while also backing regional biodiversity activities and international cooperation on natural history collections. A key deliverable in this package is the G20 Recommendations on enhancing science engagement. Endorsed by all G20 Ministers, this package aims to promote transparency, foster collaboration, build inclusive science systems, counter misinformation, and strengthen public trust in science.
The G20 Research and Innovation Ministerial Meeting is a pivotal forum that brings together G20 members and invited countries to collaborate on pressing global issues through the lens of science, technology, and innovation. Founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the G20 has expanded its focus to include a diverse range of global challenges, recognising that sustainable development and inclusive growth are closely linked to advancements in STI.
South Africa is holding the G20 Presidency from 1st December 2024 until 31 November 2025. It is the first time the African continent hosts G20. To tackle global crises as climate change, underdevelopment, inequality, poverty, hunger, unemployment, technological changes and geopolitical instability, South Africa has embraced the theme “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability” for its G20 Presidency.
The 2025 G20 R&I Ministerial meeting, hosted in Tshwane (Pretoria), South Africa, continues the G20 tradition by addressing critical themes such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and socioeconomic inequality. Through its Ministerial Declaration, the G20 strives to foster open innovation, equitable access, and strategic international partnerships, paving the way for collective actions and transformative solutions to the world’s most urgent challenges."

Fishing vessel engine power - new Commission guidance for monitoring and control,https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/news/fishing-vessel-engine-power-new-commission-guidance-monitoring-and-control-2025-10-10_en,10 October 2025,The European Commission has published two technical guidance documents to support EU countries in improving their systems for monitoring and controlling the engine power of fishing vessels.,"The European Commission has published two technical guidance documents to support EU countries in improving their systems for monitoring and controlling the engine power of fishing vessels.
Engine power of fishing vessels is one of the measures used to control fishing effort and to determine the size of European fishing fleets, in order to ensure the sustainable management of marine resources. Reliable registered power values are crucial for effective fishing effort management.
Both guidance documents address shortcomings identified in the 2019 Commission study on engine power verification and also respond to EU countries’ requests for technical support.
They aim to foster sustainable fishing practices and provide support to EU countries for the upcoming implementation of the new continuous engine power monitoring systems, which will become mandatory in January 2028 following the revision of the fisheries Control Regulation.
Both guidance documents have been developed with the help of EU countries’ experts in the field of engine power certification and verification, as well as other external experts and relevant stakeholders.
Under the EU’s common fisheries policy (CFP), the engine power (kW) of a fishing vessel is a key metric for ensuring the sustainable management of fish stocks. Accurate data on engine power allows to regulate the size of the European fishing fleet, for which the CFP sets specific ceilings for each EU country.
In other words, by accurately declaring, registering and controlling engine power, EU countries crucially contribute to:
The two new documents provide the following specific technical advice:
This document will help EU countries setting up harmonised systems for monitoring, certifying and verifying the engine power of catching vessels, as required by the EU fisheries Control Regulation.
The EU fisheries Control Regulation requires the continuous monitoring of engine power for certain categories of high-risk catching vessels as of 10 January 2028. This document will provide EU countries with technical specifications to prepare for a successful and timely rollout.
The Commission has invited EU countries to use both guidance documents when implementing the fisheries Control Regulation. It has also invited EU countries to report to the Commission any implementation issues they encounter, providing input for potential follow-up actions and knowledge-sharing within the technical working group.

At today’s panel discussion organised by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for the Middle East, North Africa and Gulf (DG MENA) at the Global Gateway Forum, this objective was confirmed. The EU reaffirmed its commitment to support both Medusa’s ongoing development and its expansion most notably to the Middle East.
The Medusa Submarine Cable System, owned by AFR-IX telecom and with a projected cost of €342 million, is the landmark digital infrastructure initiative, with 8700 km of high-speed internet cable being deployed across the Mediterranean. Medusa will directly interconnect the Northern and Southern shores of the Mediterranean, providing a high-capacity, multi-country, future-proof optical fibre submarine cable.
Through this programme, almost 500 education and research establishments in North Africa will be provided with improved connection to EU National Research and Education Networks (NRENs). Via funds to the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU connects research centres in the Southern Neighbourhood and via funds to GÉANT, the European National Research and Education Networks, it increases the capacity of NRENs. Through the Connecting Europe Facility, the EU supports the deployment of the submarine cables.
Today, DG MENA gathered representatives of AFR-IX, EU Member States, partner countries, banks and private sector to discuss possible strategic expansion of Medusa, focusing on digital connectivity to Jordan, and the broader Middle East. The session served for stakeholders to identify concrete investment opportunities in the digital sector, to enhance existing partnerships and work together for the future of the Mediterranean.
The European Commissioner for the Mediterranean, Dubravka Šuica, said: “The Mediterranean has always been a sea of connection - for thousands of years, people and goods have crossed its waters. Today, a new link binds us together beneath the surface: submarine cables. The Medusa system is a remarkable example of how innovation can bridge distances, delivering high-quality internet to communities, schools, and research institutions across the region. In a rapidly changing world, Medusa ensures that no one is left behind - not even in the digital realm.”
Medusa Submarine Cable System
The digital markets in the MENA region have been rapidly evolving but, disparities in internet access and speed remain, due to regulatory hurdles, limited infrastructure, and broader political and economic challenges. On the other hand, opportunities can be found in the expansion of fibre-optic infrastructure, and government-backed digital transformation initiatives.
With a projected cost of €342 million, including an DG MENA’s contribution of €40 million, the Medusa optical fibre submarine cable is crucial in meeting the growing demand for high-speed data traffic, as submarine cables support 98% of global internet traffic. The landing points of the cable include:

This announcement, unveiled during the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels, is an important milestone in the “Scaling Up Renewables in Africa” campaign, co-hosted with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and coordinated with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen.
This campaign raises global awareness and mobilises public and private investments for clean energy generation and access across Africa. European Commission President von der Leyen said: “Africa has everything it needs to become a global leader in clean energy — vision, talent and abundant natural resources. With this €618 million Team Europe package, we are joining with our African partners to power a clean and sustainable energy future for the continent.”
Africa's renewable energy potential is huge: the continent is home to 60% of the world's best solar resources. Scaling up investment in renewable energy is a strategic opportunity to boost green industrialisation, create jobs, and build climate resilience.
Through the Global Gateway investment strategy, the European Union is working with African partners to seize this opportunity. The EU is delivering major investments in renewable energy generation, transmission and cross-border electricity trade, while building long-term, reliable partnerships to support Africa's clean energy future.
Today's €618 million package will go towards projects that support electrification, modernising power grids, and expanding access to renewable energy.
Projects announced include:
Additional EU commitments under the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with South Africa were also announced at the Global Gateway Forum, underlining strong EU–South Africa cooperation on the energy transition.
These announcements build on the €545 million package unveiled at the UN General Assembly only weeks ago, showing that the EU continues to deliver on its commitments. They form part of the Africa-EU Green Energy Initiative (AEGEI), launched at the 6th EU-AU Summit in 2022, which aims to unlock Africa's vast renewable electricity potential and provide at least 100 million people with access to power by 2030. The initiative brings together 12 EU Member States, their Development Finance Institutions, the European Investment Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in a coordinated Team Europe approach.
The ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa' campaign was launched by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the G20 Summit in Brazil in November 2024.
The campaign, developed in partnership with Global Citizen, aims to mobilise international commitments from governments, development banks and the private sector to boost renewable energy access across Africa. The Global Gateway Investment Hub will provide an entry point for companies looking for EU investment support through the Global Gateway strategy.
The momentum will continue at the G20 Summit in Johannesburg (22–23 November 2025), where world leaders and investors are expected to announce further commitments under the Scaling Up Renewables in Africa campaign.
The Global Gateway Forum brings together an assembly of government representatives from the European Union and across the globe, alongside key stakeholders from the private sector, civil society, thought leaders, financial institutions, and international organisations to promote global investment in infrastructure - hard and soft - to deliver on the SDGs and sustainable growth and resilience worldwide.
Global Gateway is the EU's positive offer to reduce the worldwide investment disparity and boost smart, clean and secure connections in digital, energy and transport sectors, and to strengthen health, education and research systems.
The Global Gateway strategy embodies a Team Europe approach that brings together the European Union, EU Member States, and European development finance institutions. Together, we aim to mobilise up to €300 billion in public and private investments from 2021 to 2027, creating essential links rather than dependencies, and closing the global investment gap.
Africa has everything it needs to become a global leader in clean energy — vision, talent and abundant natural resources. With this €618 million Team Europe package, we are joining with our African partners to power a clean and sustainable energy future for the continent.

In the introductory remarks, the EU co-chair emphasised the new political directions of European Commissioner Ekaterina Zaharieva, focusing on Startups, Research and Innovation, and its impact on the cooperation between the parties. Detailed presentations were given on new EU initiatives such as the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy, the forthcoming European Research Area Act, the Innovation Act and the European Commission proposal for the 10th Framework Programme.
The Bosnian Herzegovinian side presented the latest updates on the country’s R&I policy landscape, such as the development and adoption of a Science and Innovation Strategy by the Canton of Sarajevo, and their national support measures including the organization of a Horizon Europe Info Day on 6 October 2025.
The two sides took the opportunity to discuss the implementation of the Horizon Europe Association Agreement, such as the increasing participation of entities from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and how participation could grow even further. In addition, further steps on the implementation of the reciprocity principle were examined.
Moreover, the two parties reviewed participation under specific Horizon Europe Actions, with a special focus on the European Innovation Council and the progress made by Sarajevo as a Mission city. In addition, the broad activities of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in Bosnia and Herzegovina, opportunities provided by the Digital Innovation Hubs, and by the Western Balkans Growth Plan were presented. The Joint Research Centre informed about the progress made concerning the development of a national Smart Specialisation Strategy.
The meeting offered a good occasion for the EU to recall the importance of the Horizon Europe programme for the country’s researchers and its innovation ecosystem, especially in the context of Bosnia and Herzegovina being an EU candidate country.
The next Horizon Europe Joint Committee Meeting is foreseen to take place in Sarajevo in 2026."
Commission publishes Terms and Conditions for the first pilot auction for industrial heat decarbonisation with a budget of €1 billion,https://climate.ec.europa.eu/news-other-reads/news/commission-publishes-terms-and-conditions-first-pilot-auction-industrial-heat-decarbonisation-budget-2025-10-10_en,10 October 2025,"For the first time, the Innovation Fund will launch an auction to decarbonise industrial process heat, awarding subsidies linked to carbon abatement and paving the way for the future Industrial Decarbonisation Bank.","On 10 October 2025, the Commission published the final Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) for its first European-wide auction for decarbonising industrial process heat (IF25 Heat Auction). Process heat refers to the energy used to generate high temperatures for manufacturing activities in sectors such as chemicals, steel, or cement. Implemented via the Innovation Fund and announced in the Clean Industrial Deal, this auction aims to support the market uptake of electrified and direct renewable heat technologies in industrial process heating, advancing the decarbonisation of the European industry.
Funded by revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System, the auction has a budget of €1 billion to support innovative projects that electrify industrial process heat using technologies such as heat pumps, boilers, plasma torches, resistance heating and induction heating. It can also back projects harnessing direct renewable heat - for example solar thermal or geothermal - as well as hybrid projects that combine different electrification and direct renewable heat technologies.
Building on the success of the Innovation Fund auctions for renewable hydrogen production, under the European Hydrogen Bank, the final T&Cs were prepared following collaborative public consultations with industry and stakeholders. The auction’s budget may also be topped up by national contributions via Auction-as-a-Service, an approach that has already proven successful in previous hydrogen auctions.
The new pilot auction is expected to open to bidders in early December 2025. The publication of the final T&Cs provides the opportunity for interested applicants to review the requirements and prepare their bids ahead of the opening of the bidding window. Any questions on the final T&C can be sent to CLIMA-AUCTIONSec [dot] europa [dot] eu (CLIMA-AUCTIONS[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu)
Principal features outlined in the Terms and Conditions include:
This auction targets  one of the biggest sources of EU industrial CO2 emissions: process heating. This refers to the heat used to transform raw materials into products; from melting plastics and metals to driving chemical reactions. Today, these processes are largely powered by fossil fuels. All industrial sectors have such processes and can bid in the pilot auction.
The IF25 Heat Auction aims to close the cost gap between direct renewable heat or electrification solutions and fossil fuel-based alternatives. By de-risking these innovative projects, it not only enhances the competitiveness of clean industries in Europe, but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, boosts energy independence and security, improves energy price affordability, and brings our continent closer to achieving its climate neutrality goals by 2050. With this auction, the Commission continues to deliver on the Clean Industrial Deal and takes a key step toward establishing the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank.
Kurt Vandenberghe, Director-General, Directorate-General for Climate Action, said:
""This auction is a crucial stepping stone toward the establishment of the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank. It opens the door to scaling investments in industrial electrification technologies driving industrial decarbonisation. I call on industry leaders to join us in tapping into the vast potential for cost-effective emission reductions through electrification and prepare their bids for the auction that will open early December.""
The Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for commercialising and deploying innovative low-carbon and net-zero technologies. Financed by revenues from the EU Emissions Trading System, it helps businesses invest in clean energy and bring market-ready solutions to scale – driving industrial decarbonisation and strengthening European competitiveness. The Fund has already allocated around €12 billion to around 200 innovative projects across the European Economic Area.
The IF25 Heat Auction follows the announcement made in the Clean Industrial Deal of a pilot Innovation Fund auction under the Industrial Decarbonisation Bank. The bank is a new initiative which aims to provide €100 billion in funding for industrial decarbonisation."
Global Gateway Forum: EU and EDFI sign three guarantee agreements to mobilise private investments in partner countries,https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/global-gateway-forum-eu-and-edfi-sign-three-guarantee-agreements-mobilise-private-investments-2025-10-10_en,10 October 2025,"Today at the Global Gateway Forum, the European Commission and European Development Finance Institutions announced three new guarantee agreements to mobilise private finance for development.","Today at the Global Gateway Forum, the European Commission and European Development Finance Institutions announced three new guarantee agreements to mobilise private finance for development. The guarantees aim to strengthen value chains across various sectors, expand access to renewable energy, and unlock private equity financing, providing financial coverage for a total amount of €742 million. They are part of the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+), one of the financing tools of Global Gateway, promoting sustainable investments in partner countries.
Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jozef Síkela, said: “These new guarantees signed today by the EU and the EDFI, as Team Europe, will help mobilise investment in renewable energy projects and new value chains in our partner countries. This is the core principle of Global Gateway: de-risking investment to create jobs, boost local businesses, and strengthen resilience.”
Commissioner for the Mediterranean, Dubravka Šuica, stated: “Very pleased to sign a new guarantee agreements with EDFI today. The contribution of all European Development Finance Institutions is the best expression of working in a Team Europe spirit and will contribute to deliver Global Gateway investment in the Mediterranean. We look forward to see these agreements translated into concrete investments, particularly in supporting local value chains and partnerships with European industries.”
Commissioner for Enlargement, Marta Kos, commented: “Today’s signature is a call to invest: in railways, in energy corridors, in digital networks. Our neighbourhood is changing. Our partners seek to reduce dependencies. For the first time in generations, new trade routes from Europe to Central Asia are opening. This can be an economic win-win for all.”
The first guarantee is for the Transforming Global Value Chains programme. The EU will guarantee up to €194 million for investments in developing local value chains and fostering local value creation across agribusiness, health, manufacturing, and processing in sectors such as digital, logistics or textiles.
With the second guarantee for the Renewable Energy Transition programme, the EU will support investments in renewable energy projects. The €332 million guarantee will back initiatives in on- and off-grid power generation, transmission and distribution, as well as energy storage.
The third guarantee, the Liquidity Platform for Impact, supported by the EU with €216 million, will facilitate flows of new investments in partner countries by creating a secondary financial market. Attracting early-stage financing remains one of the biggest challenges for European investors in our partner countries, and this mechanism aims to help overcome that barrier.
All these new guarantees build on the existing programmes with EDFI MC, increasing the total guarantee capacity to €1.6 billion - providing EDFI and its members with a versatile investment toolkit.
The signing ceremony brought together high-level representatives: European Commissioners Jozef Síkela, Dubravka Šuica and Marta Kos, the General Manager of European Development Finance Institutions David Kuijper and representatives of three Development Finance Institutions  that are the main users of the guarantee – Michael Jongeneel of FMO, the Dutch entrepreneurial development bank; Roland Siller, CEO of DEG, the German private sector investment corporation; and Jean-Baptiste Sabatie, Deputy CEO of Proparco, the private sector development bank of the French AFD Group.

New EU rules on political advertising come into effect,/news-and-media/news/new-eu-rules-political-advertising-come-effect-2025-10-10_en,10 October 2025,"From 10 October, new EU-wide rules apply that will help us to navigate and understand the complex online and offline political arena better, with more transparency.","Have you ever run into a political advertisement in a newspaper or a webpage, without being aware that a political party or a foreign entity was behind it? This is just one example, in the age of information, we are increasingly faced with. From 10 October, new EU-wide rules apply that will help us to navigate and understand this complex online and offline political arena better, with more transparency.
The rules make it easy for us to recognise political advertisements, understand who is paying for them and know whether and how we were targeted to receive these advertisements. This way we are better placed to exercise our democratic rights in an informed manner. The new rules will also ensure that political advertising fully respects our right to privacy and that our freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are protected.
From now on in the EU:
The new rules do not apply to any views expressed in a personal capacity and editorial content.  The Regulation does not regulate the content of political ads.
The European Commission has issued guidelines on how those affected by the rules can effectively implement them. This includes sponsors, providers of political advertising services and political advertising publishers.
These political advertising rules complement other initiatives launched by the EU to protect our democracy and to promote free and fair elections. In 2020, the Commission launched a European Democracy Action Plan to empower citizens, strengthen media freedom and build more resilient democracies across the EU.
Looking ahead, by the end of 2025 the Commission will adopt the European Democracy Shield, a strategic framework designed to safeguard, strengthen and promote democracy in the EU.

EU Ecolabel hits record numbers as green opportunities for businesses and consumers grow,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-ecolabel-hits-record-numbers-green-opportunities-grow-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"Italy tops the rankings in terms of products certified under the scheme, followed closely by Spain, France and Germany.","The EU Ecolabel has reached a historic milestone: more than 109,096 products now covered by 3,384 licences across Europe carry its trusted logo – the widest range of eco-friendly choices ever available under the scheme.
The EU Ecolabel is gaining momentum, offering new opportunities for businesses and greener choices for consumers. Since March 2025, certified products have increased by 7% (+6,723), while licences have grown by 4% (+136).
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a central role in the success of the EU Ecolabel. They make up 57% of all licence holders, showing that Europe’s green transition is being driven from the ground up.
With 97% of licences based in the European Economic Area, local businesses are turning sustainable ideas into tangible solutions that benefit both markets and the environment.
Some countries are emerging as clear leaders in EU Ecolabel certification. Italy tops the rankings with 17% of all certified products, followed by Spain (15%), France (12%) and Germany (9%).
Together, these four countries account for more than half of the EU Ecolabel’s presence across Europe, underlining their strong commitment to sustainable production and consumption.
At the same time, Denmark, Czechia, Portugal and Sweden are steadily expanding their eco-labelled offerings, confirming that demand for sustainable products is spreading across Europe.
The EU Ecolabel is now firmly visible in products used in daily life. Paints & varnishes are in the lead, with 38,096 certified products, followed by tissue paper & tissue products (20,253), textiles (11,067) and hard surface cleaning products (8,284).
Tourist accommodations remain the largest product group in terms of licences, representing 26% of all licences, with 901 certified establishments. Over the past six months, an additional 64 new licenses have joined the EU Ecolabel, further reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable tourism.
Alongside the progress, some categories, such as reusable menstrual cups, electronic displays and animal care products, are still underrepresented, leaving space for companies to meet new consumer needs while gaining a competitive edge through visibility and credibility.
Examples from pioneering companies show what this opportunity can look like in practice.
Kroll in Italy boosted its competitiveness by certifying nearly all its cosmetics, raising product value and opening doors to procurement (read more).
Chemi-Pharm in Estonia gained access to hospital tenders across Europe, with certified products now accounting for over 10% of its revenue (read more).
Drylock in Belgium turned the EU Ecolabel into a strategic asset in the hygiene sector, partnering with major retailers and reinforcing its leadership in circular innovation (read more).
These examples underline a simple message: the EU Ecolabel is helping companies compete more effectively, win procurement opportunities and build lasting trust with consumers.
With record-breaking figures and momentum still building, the scheme is proving that going green delivers business growth as well as environmental benefits.

Fuelling Europe’s green energy revolution with mussel by-products,https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/news/fuelling-europes-green-energy-revolution-mussel-products-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"In the French region of Brittany, a pioneering project is transforming undersized mussels, once considered waste, into valuable green energy through methanisation. This process produces methane gas, a renewable energy, from organic materials.","In the French region of Brittany, a pioneering project is transforming undersized mussels, once considered waste, into valuable green energy through methanisation. This process produces methane gas, a renewable energy, from organic materials. With the help from the EU, this project supports sustainable practices, local, eco-friendly waste management and reduces transportation costs.
Along the coast of Brittany, mussel farmers have long faced a persistent challenge: up to 20% of their yearly harvest consists of young, undersized mussels, amounting to 6 000 to 12 000 tonnes. These smaller shellfish do not meet the criteria for high-value products such as those eligible for protected designation of origin.
In the past, they were often discarded back into the sea, causing environmental harm, or left to rot. However, rising pressure from environmental authorities is pushing the sector towards fully traceable valorisation chains and away from open-air disposal by 2025–2026.
One of these industrial valorisation processes is biological fermentation, where microorganisms break mussel waste down into smaller units (hydrolysate) that can be used to generate methane, a clean, renewable energy source.
Additionally, mussel shells can be repurposed as agricultural fertiliser or animal feed, creating a closed-loop system and adding value to materials that would otherwise be discarded.
Inspired by circular‑economy principles, mussel producers, local authorities, and scientific researchers have developed a mobile processing unit that can be deployed directly on mussel farms. This unit allows for the local processing of mussel waste, eliminating the need for costly and environmentally harmful transportation.
“We don't want to travel 1km for 1kg of mussels, so the aim is to integrate this new practice into the profession’s practices” says Jean-Marie Grosmaitre, Site Director at Cultimer.
The project brings advantages to everyone
“We've been approached by local authorities to recover household and catering waste of meat origin. So, there's a real potential for development on a much wider scale than just mussel farming.” says Jean-Marie Grosmaitre.
Funding from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and regional initiatives has been crucial in developing the technology and preparing the prototype for use across mussel farms in France.
This innovative project is set to transform the way mussel farming handles waste, providing a sustainable solution that benefits both the environment and the economy.

Team Europe reaches €300 billion target for Global Gateway investments ahead of time,https://north-africa-middle-east-gulf.ec.europa.eu/news/team-europe-reaches-eu300-billion-target-global-gateway-investments-ahead-time-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"Today at the opening of the Global Gateway Forum, President von der Leyen laid down her vision for strengthened partnerships in a radically changing global economy.","Today at the opening of the Global Gateway Forum, President von der Leyen laid down her vision for strengthened partnerships in a radically changing global economy. With Global Gateway as the EU's external investment strategy, the EU has the power to lead this change. This determination is already delivering results and is outpacing its initial objectives. At the forum, the President announced that Team Europe – EU, Member States, and Development financing institutions - has mobilised over €306 billion in just four years, already meeting the target set in 2021. This was achieved two years ahead of the initial 2027 target.
European Commission President von der Leyen said: “With Global Gateway, Europe's investment strategy, we set an ambitious target of €300 billion by 2027. Along the way, it became clear that the world needs not just investments, but partnerships. Genuine partnerships based on respect, shared interests and long-term commitment. This is the essence and the success of Global Gateway. And today I am confident we will surpass €400 billion by 2027.”
The 2025 Global Gateway Forum, attended by 12 Heads of State and Government and over 70 Ministers from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, provides a unique platform to turn ideas into investment partnerships, and bring projects closer to their achievement.
In the current competitive and transactional environment, all countries face the same challenges: securing access to capital, resources and technology, reducing dangerous dependencies, and strengthening strategic autonomy. Against this background, the EU and partners countries must invest in diversification and reliable partnerships.
Today and throughout the Forum, President von der Leyen, together with High Representative Vice-President Kallas, Executive Vice-President Ribera, Commissioner Síkela, Commissioner Šuica and Commissioner Kos will echo a clear message: Team Europe is a reliable and transparent partner for strong partnerships based on values and shared interests, and this joint work delivers good results.
Global Gateway is Europe's offer to partner countries, delivering both on national, regional and global challenges, but also on the EU's strategic interests. For instance, the EU has mobilised over €2 billion to upgrade transport infrastructure along the Solidarity Lanes between Ukraine, Moldova, and Member States, helping Ukraine export goods such as grain to international markets. Further, the Lobito Corridor in Central Africa will link Angola's Atlantic coast with Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. By reducing transport times from 45 days to just one week, the project will improve regional integration, lower emissions, and unlock opportunities for local industries and communities.
Similar partnerships are being advanced worldwide, ranging from the digital transition in Colombia and regional electricity integration in Guatemala, to digital connectivity in the Middle East via the MEDUSA Submarine Optical Fibre Cable, water security via the the Aqaba-Amman Water Desalination, cultural heritage protection in Iraq, and clean energy projects in South Africa, Togo and Mauritania. They also include strategic port modernisation in Cabo Verde, as well as the development of new food and health value chains in Africa and the Caribbean.
At the Global Gateway Forum, tangible progress will be made with partners from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, EU's Neighbourhood and the MENA region to advance Global Gateway on several fronts and across continents. Leaders from countries such as the Angola, Armenia, Cabo Verde, Colombia, Grenada, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Mauritania, Rwanda, South Africa, will come together with key stakeholders from the private sector, civil society, thought leaders, financial institutions, and international organisations. Together, they will work to deepen cooperation and mobilise global investment in both hard and soft infrastructure, laying the groundwork for sustainable growth and resilience.
Commissioner for International Partnerships Jozef Síkela added: “The success of Global Gateway shows a growing demand for partnership with Europe, that is based on reliability, transparency, and mutual benefit. This is a great opportunity for Europe and at this year's Global Gateway Forum, together with our partners, we are turning that demand into action, identifying new opportunities, expanding our cooperation, and proving that when Europe and its partners work together, we deliver real impact for both sides.”
Over 150 top European companies are present at the Forum, alongside governments, development banks and export credit agencies. President von der Leyen stressed that public funds alone cannot meet the world's investment needs and highlighted Global Gateway's role in mobilising private capital. For this reason, the new Global Gateway Investment Hub will provide an entry point for companies looking for EU investment support through the Global Gateway in countries. Grants, concessional loans and guarantees are used to share risk and make projects viable for business.
On the second day of the Forum, a series of Scale-up Sessions on Global Gateway flagship projects will take place, gathering governments, financial institutions, and private sector leaders. These sessions will focus on concrete investment commitments across key sectors, including:
A cooperation agreement between the European Commission and the World Bank Group will also be signed at the Global Gateway Forum.
Global Gateway is the EU's external investment strategy to build smart, clean, and secure connections in the digital, energy, and transport sectors, as well as strengthen health, education and research systems globally. It fits the current geopolitical context by nurturing equal partnerships that increase strategic autonomy and resilience of Europe and partner countries alike. It is an attractive offer thanks to its sustainable investments. It is the EU's contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals beyond its borders.
With Global Gateway, Europe’s investment strategy, we set an ambitious target of €300 billion by 2027. Along the way, it became clear that the world needs not just investments, but partnerships. Genuine partnerships based on respect, shared interests and long-term commitment. This is the essence and the success of Global Gateway. And today I am confident we will surpass €400 billion by 2027.
Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission
The success of Global Gateway shows a growing demand for partnership with Europe, based on reliability, transparency, and mutual benefit. This is a great opportunity for Europe and at this year’s Global Gateway Forum, together with our partners, we are turning that demand into action, identifying new opportunities, expanding our cooperation, and proving that when Europe and its partners work together, we deliver real impact for both sides.

Boosting the use of AI will make strategic industries more competitive,https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/boosting-use-ai-will-make-strategic-industries-more-competitive-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"Latest insights on AI uptake in public sector, SMEs, educational offer and jobs demand.","AI fast-paced development is undeniable, and to maintain a competitive advantage for the EU, its adoption rate should be accelerated.
With the new Apply AI Strategy, the Commission seeks to boost AI adoption  across key industrial sectors, especially  small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), enhance efficiency and accessibility of public services and support the development of European AI frontier models.
JRC experts analysed the results of the public consultation and call for evidence that helped shape the Apply AI Strategy, translated into the factual report accompanying the Communication. Key takeaways highlight thatrespondents’ primary concerns relate to European innovation and competitiveness and a call for investments in infrastructure, talent, funding, and collaboration. In addition, JRC’s multidisciplinary expertise in AI offers insights into multiple areas targeted by the Strategy.
AI literacy and skills are deemed essential in the strategy, to equip a robust workforce with the right competences to make the EU a competitive AI ecosystem. Comparing the AI-related education offer with labour market demand provides insights into potential AI-related skills gaps that can be tackled through evidence-informed policy actions.
JRC research shows that the most demanded AI-related roles in online job advertisements are AI and Machine Learning (ML) engineer, AI/ML developer, Data analyst and Data engineer – and these are concentrated in two occupation groups: Software and Applications Developers and Analysts, and Database and Network Professionals.
Education and training offered in the form of master’s degrees and short professional courses is primarily concentrated in ML, Generic AI, Robotics and automation, and AI ethics. While the inclusion of AI ethics is very positive, Generative AI has a much lower focus, suggesting a need to increase education and training on this topic.
Finally, education and training offer is concentrated in the field of ICT, with a much lower concentration in other fields – such as Social Sciences, Administration and Law, and Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction, to name a few. This suggests a need for more AI-related education and training in non-ICT fields to contribute to a more diversified and multidisciplinary workforce.
The Apply AI Strategy considers AI adoption in the public sector as largely beneficial, signalling a commitment to modernising public services through AI technologies.
JRC extensive research provided comprehensive frameworks and actionable recommendations to help public administrations in their AI adoption journey – including the potential of emerging technologies, such as Generative AI.
The JRC analysed the factors that influence public managers’ perception of AI adoption. The study, mentioned in the Strategy, highlights how AI uptake is already a reality rather than a promise, as well as the importance of organisational factors such as leadership support, innovative culture, and in-house expertise for a successful AI adoption.
The JRC is also the scientific partner of the Public Sector Tech Watch observatory, maintaining a growing repository of AI use cases across EU administrations. This will be used for further analysis and research to support the implementation of the Apply AI Strategy.
The Apply AI Strategy proposes to strengthen the role of the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) in helping European SMEs, startups and public sector organisations increase their digitalisation levels. Transformed into Experience Centres for AI,  they will serve as privileged access points for companies to the EU AI innovation ecosystem.
A new JRC report analyses strengths and gaps in the EDIH Network to understand their readiness for this upgrade, highlighting how they effectively support AI adoption by addressing customer challenges and providing training. At the same time, the report highlights areas for improvement, such as guidance on regulation and ethics, which remain key focus areas for the next generation of EDIHs.
The analysis, based on interviews and data on their activities, finds that most EDIHs already expressed the intention of improving their offer of legal and ethical guidance for their customers, as well as to increase their AI training and workshop offer.

5 things you should know about biogas and biomethane,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/5-things-you-should-know-about-biogas-and-biomethane-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"Despite their benefits for the climate and our energy security, biogas and biomethane are still subject to persistent myths and misunderstandings. Here are 5 key things you should know.","Biogases play an important role in the transition to clean energy. They are produced domestically, unlike natural gas, which is a fossil fuel that the EU mostly imports. Biogases are part of the solution to break the EU’s dependency on imported Russian fossil fuels against the backdrop of its war in Ukraine.
The EU plans to step up biogas and biomethane production. In 2023, in the EU, 6% of natural gas was replaced with 16 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) of biogases.
Despite their benefits for the climate and our energy security, biogas and biomethane are still subject to persistent myths and misunderstandings. Here are 5 key things you should know.
Biogas or biomethane generated from 'no-oxygen' bacteria, or 'anaerobic digestion', does not harm human health when produced in safe and well-regulated environments.
Anaerobic digestion has been happening naturally for billions of years in swamps and marshes - and for thousands of years in cows’ stomachs! You might remember from school biology lessons that organic matter decomposes thanks to bacteria. Some of these are special bacteria that only live in places without oxygen like swamps, deep lakes, landfills or animals’ intestines. With the help of microbes, they produce biogas while eating and breaking down the waste.
By observing nature, scientists were able to recreate this process in controlled conditions (with specific temperatures, mix of feedstock and feeding times) and under constant monitoring. Biogas is produced in strong, secure, fortress-like, structures to make sure bacteria stay safe in the oxygen-free environment.
Biogas systems can actually help manage pathogens in organic waste and manure. According to the European Food Safety Authority, standard biogas processing effectively eliminates most heat-sensitive bacteria, viruses and parasites in waste and animal by-products, improving sanitation and safety, compared to fresh manure.
Biogas plants can be a friendly neighbour, thanks to modern technology, design and operation.
Well-managed biogas projects help to improve the environment, local economy and quality of life. In the coastal region of Køge Bay, Denmark, for example, biogas production from pig slurry, pulp and algae has helped clean the bay by reducing an overload of nutrients and organic matter (eutrophication).
The result: better water quality, recreational areas restored, increased property values, improved quality of life. The recirculated nutrients benefit the organic sector by delivering sustainable fertilisers compliant with strict regulations on organic produce.
Concerns like smell, noise or emissions of methane and ammonia can be mitigated effectively, for instance by covering feedstock storage or using air filtration systems. In fact, biogas production offers positive benefits for communities, as opposed to conventional waste or manure management. For example, digesting manure in closed systems helps reduce odour and methane and ammonia emissions that would otherwise occur in open storage. It also reduces contamination of groundwater and nutrient run-off.
Manure, landfill and decomposing organic waste release methane, a greenhouse gas 28 times more potent than CO2! Instead of letting methane escape into the air, biogas plants collect it through controlled and sealed anaerobic digestion, producing biogas.
As such, it plays a vital role in meeting the EU’s clean energy and climate targets as it offers cleaner, renewable alternatives to fossil fuels, especially fossil gas. By-products of anaerobic digestion can even be used as a biofertiliser to enrich soil.
As bacteria break down the organic matter, they produce renewable, home-made biogas. This can then be used as energy to cook food, heat homes, produce electricity, and even as a fuel for cars, trucks and ships. As such, it helps to decarbonise hard-to-electrify sectors, like heavy industry and transport, while promoting a more circular economy.
In some cases, biogas and biomethane can even deliver negative emissions. When produced from manure, sewage sludge, or food waste, the process captures the methane and CO₂ that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.
The production of biogas and biomethane generates useful, sustainable, homegrown, by-products like digestate, biogenic CO₂, and biochar.
Digestate is the organic residue from anaerobic digestion. It is rich in nutrients like phosphorus - a critical raw material for the EU. It contains nitrogen and potash, which the EU has to otherwise import. It can be used to enrich soil, or made into biofertiliser, providing a cleaner alternative to synthetic fertilisers, if properly applied in farming. This not only supports sustainable farming but also generates extra income for biogas producers.
Biogenic CO2 is a purified form of CO2 separated from the biomethane gas. It can be captured, stored and used as in various applications like as boosting agent for plants in greenhouses, biochemical production, water treatment, and the food and beverage sector.
Biochar can improve soil health and breaks down feedstock. It also serves as a land-based option for carbon removal as it locks carbon into the ground for the long term.
Biomethane is a homegrown, secure energy source and is cleaner and more affordable compared to fossil fuels.
Biogas and biomethane use established technologies where the EU excels globally. Europe has developed efficient production systems that create local jobs and boost technological autonomy.
Unlike renewable energy sources that rely on the weather, biomethane offers a source of stable, on-demand supply of renewable electricity. It can help balance the electricity grid while providing clean energy for households, industry, and transport.
Biomethane, as a molecule, can replace fossil gas across different industries as a basic chemical.
No-oxygen environments can be recreated at large scale - in a biogas plant where special closed tanks (known as digestors or fermentors) are used. They are usually built where the waste or feedstock is abundant. There are mainly 4 types of biogas production plants
If we remove carbon dioxide from biogas, it becomes biomethane: a renewable gas. Biomethane can go directly into the gas grid or be used as a clean fuel. The cleaning process also captures biogenic CO2, which can replace fossil CO2 in many processes or be removed permanently from the greenhouse gas emission cycle.
Biogas and biomethane are increasingly recognised as valuable for advancing the clean energy transition. Renewable, domestically produced gases can help reduce emissions, strengthen energy security, and contribute to a more circular and resource-efficient economy, particularly in hard-to-electrify sectors like hard to abate industries and transport.
When produced and managed according to high environmental and safety standards, biogas systems are safe and bring wider benefits to communities, including improved waste management, reduced emissions and generation of valuable by-products for agriculture and industry. At the same time, outcomes vary depending on how a plant is designed, the type and mix of feedstock used, and operational processes to produce biogas, making the use of best practices essential.
While biogas and biomethane are not a stand-alone solution for a fully decarbonised economy, they offer flexible, scalable contributions to the EU’s climate and energy objectives. Their continued development, supported by sound policy and innovation, can play an important role in building a more resilient and sustainable energy system in the EU."

A new digital gateway for Swedish aquaculture,https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/news/new-digital-gateway-swedish-aquaculture-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"The Food Fish Farmers, known in Sweden as Matfiskodlarna, serves as the country’s hub for aquaculture knowledge. With the support from the EU, the organisation developed a modern digital gateway to strengthen knowledge exchange, support collaboration, and inspire the future of Swedish aquaculture.","The Food Fish Farmers, known in Sweden as Matfiskodlarna, serves as the country’s hub for aquaculture knowledge. With the support from the EU, the organisation developed a modern digital gateway to strengthen knowledge exchange, support collaboration, and inspire the future of Swedish aquaculture.
The Food Fish Farmers is the leading industry organisation for fish farmers in Sweden, uniting producers from north to south. Together, their member companies produce up to 20,000 tonnes of fish annually, focusing primarily on Arctic char and rainbow trout. From hatchery to harvest, they are involved in every stage of production, ensuring high-quality fish reach Swedish and international markets.
The organisation’s website is crucial for communication with the sector and interested parties. However, as Wenche Hansson, CEO of the Food Fish Farmers, recalls, the previous version of the website struggled to meet expectations: “a significant part of my time was spent on answering phone calls”.
Recognising the need for an upgraded, user-friendly, and inspiring digital platform, the organisation launched a major rebuild with EU support, creating a central hub that consolidates all relevant information about Swedish aquaculture. This new digital resource allows fish farmers, researchers, policymakers, and citizens to easily access reliable, up-to-date information.
The revamped digital platform went live in January 2025 and aims to strengthen the sector. It now offers specialised information for member companies, ensuring quick access to the latest news on regulations, scientific research, and innovations helping them to adapt, collaborate, and grow.
For new entrants and students, the platform provides an invaluable introduction to the industry — demystifying aquaculture and supporting the next generation of fish farmers.
It also includes clear, accessible information for the wider public, helping to bridge knowledge gaps and challenge misconceptions about fish farming in Sweden.
“Bringing all relevant information together in one place is essential for the development of Swedish aquaculture,” Wenche says. “It saves time, reduces confusion, and helps everyone in the sector make informed decisions.”
Although the new platform has only been live since the beginning of 2025, it has already attracted visitors from 33 countries and from all over Sweden. The most popular section? An in-depth overview of how Swedish fish farming works in practice. “This is pleasing to note because it shows that we are reaching out with important facts about Swedish fish farming,” Wenche says.
With its modern interface, the platform also enables detailed analytics and visitor statistics, helping guide continuous improvements and content updates.
Looking to the future, the Food Fish Farmers plan to expand the platform with more detailed information on sustainability and practical aquaculture techniques. This will be particularly valuable for the next generation of fish farmers, as the sector faces a generational shift and new opportunities for growth. The organisation is already collaborating with Sweden’s post-secondary education programme for sustainable aquaculture, with the new knowledge hub serving as an inspiration and resource for prospective students.

Faster and safer instant euro payments become a reality,https://finance.ec.europa.eu/news/faster-and-safer-instant-euro-payments-become-reality-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"People and businesses can now transfer money in euro within seconds, anytime – day or night, weekdays or weekends – whether within their own country or across the euro area.","From today, sending money across the euro area will be faster and safer than ever. Thanks to new EU rules on instant payments, people and businesses can now transfer money in euro within seconds, anytime – day or night, weekdays or weekends – whether within their own country or across the euro area.
Since January 2025, payment service providers (PSPs) in the euro area are obliged to offer their clients the possibility to receive euro instant payments. As of today, PSPs are also obliged to offer their clients the service of sending instant payments in euro and, in order to combat payment fraud in euro credit transfers, the service of payee verification (VoP). This makes instant payments more widely available, safer, and more affordable for everyone across the euro area.
Instant payments will boost Europe's economy and bring major benefits for citizens and companies. For citizens, money is available immediately, making it far easier to deal with emergencies or splitting bills in social settings. For companies, cash flow management will be improved, as will customer service: by providing an additional payment method to customers, they will save time and reduce costs.
What changes:
Next steps
From January 2027, payment service providers outside the euro area will also be required to allow their clients to send and receive instant payments in euro and verify the beneficiary.
The Commission will closely monitor how charges for instant payments evolve and whether there are any other outstanding obstacles to the availability and use of instant payments, and will report to the EU co-legislators to ensure that they remain affordable and accessible.
Background
The Instant Payments Regulation (March 2024) updates the 2012 rules on euro credit transfers to reflect technological progress and the needs of citizens and businesses today.
The rules have been rolled out gradually to ensure a smooth transition for payment service providers. Since 9 January 2025, PSPs in the euro area are prohibited from charging higher fees for instant payments than those applicable to regular transfers. Additionally, providers that do not yet offer instant payments in euro have had to make it possible for their clients to receive them.
For More Information
Link to Q&A on implementation of Instant Payments Regulation:
Link to Official Journal
Today marks a new era for payments in Europe. The Instant Payments Regulation will substantially improve the daily lives of our citizens and businesses by allowing them to send and receive payments instantaneously, round the clock. This will make transactions more secure, with payment service providers required to verify the intended beneficiary and send an alert to the payer in case of error or suspected fraud. We will monitor the concrete implementation in Member States so that everyone can fully benefit from these new rules

President von der Leyen announces €618 million package to scale up renewables in Africa at Global Gateway Forum,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/president-von-der-leyen-announces-eu618-million-package-scale-renewables-africa-global-gateway-forum-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced today a €618 million Team Europe package to accelerate Africa's clean energy transition.,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced today a €618 million Team Europe package to accelerate Africa's clean energy transition. This announcement, unveiled during the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels, is an important milestone in the “Scaling Up Renewables in Africa” campaign, co-hosted with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and coordinated with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen.
This campaign raises global awareness and mobilises public and private investments for clean energy generation and access across Africa. European Commission President von der Leyen said: “Africa has everything it needs to become a global leader in clean energy — vision, talent and abundant natural resources. With this €618 million Team Europe package, we are joining with our African partners to power a clean and sustainable energy future for the continent.”
Africa's renewable energy potential is huge: the continent is home to 60% of the world's best solar resources. Scaling up investment in renewable energy is a strategic opportunity to boost green industrialisation, create jobs, and build climate resilience.
Through the Global Gateway investment strategy, the European Union is working with African partners to seize this opportunity. The EU is delivering major investments in renewable energy generation, transmission and cross-border electricity trade, while building long-term, reliable partnerships to support Africa's clean energy future.
Today's €618 million package will go towards projects that support electrification, modernising power grids, and expanding access to renewable energy.
Projects announced include:
Additional EU commitments under the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with South Africa were also announced at the Global Gateway Forum, underlining strong EU–South Africa cooperation on the energy transition.
These announcements build on the €545 million package unveiled at the UN General Assembly only weeks ago, showing that the EU continues to deliver on its commitments. They form part of the Africa-EU Green Energy Initiative (AEGEI), launched at the 6th EU-AU Summit in 2022, which aims to unlock Africa's vast renewable electricity potential and provide at least 100 million people with access to power by 2030. The initiative brings together 12 EU Member States, their Development Finance Institutions, the European Investment Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in a coordinated Team Europe approach.
The ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa' campaign was launched by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the G20 Summit in Brazil in November 2024.
The campaign, developed in partnership with Global Citizen, aims to mobilise international commitments from governments, development banks and the private sector to boost renewable energy access across Africa. The Global Gateway Investment Hub will provide an entry point for companies looking for EU investment support through the Global Gateway strategy.
The momentum will continue at the G20 Summit in Johannesburg (22–23 November 2025), where world leaders and investors are expected to announce further commitments under the Scaling Up Renewables in Africa campaign.
The Global Gateway Forum brings together an assembly of government representatives from the European Union and across the globe, alongside key stakeholders from the private sector, civil society, thought leaders, financial institutions, and international organisations to promote global investment in infrastructure - hard and soft - to deliver on the SDGs and sustainable growth and resilience worldwide.
Global Gateway is the EU's positive offer to reduce the worldwide investment disparity and boost smart, clean and secure connections in digital, energy and transport sectors, and to strengthen health, education and research systems.
The Global Gateway strategy embodies a Team Europe approach that brings together the European Union, EU Member States, and European development finance institutions. Together, we aim to mobilise up to €300 billion in public and private investments from 2021 to 2027, creating essential links rather than dependencies, and closing the global investment gap.
Africa has everything it needs to become a global leader in clean energy — vision, talent and abundant natural resources. With this €618 million Team Europe package, we are joining with our African partners to power a clean and sustainable energy future for the continent.

EU-Belarus: 4th Senior Officials’ Meeting takes place in Brussels,https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-belarus-4th-senior-officials-meeting-takes-place-brussels-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"On 8 October, the European Union and leaders of the Belarusian democratic forces and civil society representatives held their fourth Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) on Belarus in Brussels.","On 8 October, the European Union and leaders of the Belarusian democratic forces and civil society representatives held their fourth Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) on Belarus in Brussels.
The European Union reaffirmed its unwavering solidarity with the Belarusian people.
Building on these exchanges, the EU committed to prioritising in the next two years support for human rights in Belarus, civil society and independent media, recognising these areas as vital for a democratic future. Participants stressed the importance of further step up EU support for the released political prisoners and victims of human rights violations.
Belarusian participants stressed the urgency of sustained political and financial support in the face of continued pressure from the regime. EU representatives reaffirmed the Union’s commitment to the Belarusian people’s democratic aspirations and fundamental freedoms.
The EU and Member States also discussed how to strengthen support for released prisoners through rapid support for rehabilitation and reintegration.
At the same time, the EU recalled the alternative path. In 2021, President von der Leyen announced a comprehensive plan of up to €3 billion to support a democratic future for Belarus. Once the country embarks on a peaceful democratic transition, the EU will be ready to activate the plan and provide unprecedented support from the very beginning.
The meeting was opened by Director-General Gert Jan Koopman and EEAS Managing Director for Europe and Central Asia Matti Maasikas, together with the leader of Belarus’s democratic forces Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.
Background
In response to the mass repressions following the 2020 fraudulent presidential elections in Belarus, and in light of the Lukashenka regime’s complicity in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine since 2022, the EU suspended cooperation with Belarusian public authorities and redirected its financial assistance towards the people of Belarus. Since 2020, over €170 million has been mobilised in support of Belarusian civil society, human rights defenders and victims of repression, independent media, culture, education and professional development.
Launched in 2022, the Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM) was created to provide a structured platform for this recalibrated support. By bringing together EU institutions, Member States, and Belarusian democratic forces and civil society, it has ensured that assistance is closely aligned with the real needs of the Belarusian people. The SOM has already delivered tangible results: it has helped to identify gaps in support and led the EU to launch new programmes in underserved areas, such as the EU-funded ArtPower project in the field of culture, showcased during the 2024 Belarus Days. It has also strengthened donor coordination, built capacity within Belarusian civil society, and reinforced links across supported sectors."
"The EU is prepared for winter and beyond, confirms the latest report of European transmission system operators for gas",https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-prepared-winter-and-beyond-confirms-latest-report-european-transmission-system-operators-gas-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"The EU is well prepared for winter 2025-2026 and the months that follow, according to the annual Winter Supply Outlook published today by the European Network for Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG).","The EU is well prepared for winter 2025-2026 and the months that follow, according to the annual Winter Supply Outlook published today by the European Network for Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG).
The report points to the essential role gas storage plays in securing the winter supply as well as the ability and resilience of European infrastructure to ensure supply can meet demand, even under severe conditions.
As in previous years, the report tested the EU’s resilience against a number of scenarios where gas supply to the EU could be disrupted. This year’s report analysed, in particular, the impact of the end of imports of Russian pipeline gas.
The report concludes:
Looking ahead to next summer, the report confirms the need to continue to prepare for subsequent winters by, for example, storing gas throughout the summer months and by reducing gas demand.
The report demonstrates the independence of the EU gas system from pipeline gas supplies from Russia and underlines the significant progress achieved by the EU to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports as a whole, which is the core objective of REPowerEU.
Publication of annual winter and summer supply outlooks by ENTSOG is a requirement of the EU Regulation on the internal markets for renewable gas, natural gas and hydrogen (Regulation 2024/1789 Article 26(3)).
Commissioner for Energy and Housing, Dan Jørgensen, said:
'The Winter Supply Outlook by ENTSOG brings good news as the heating season starts: the EU is well prepared for the upcoming winter.

With Global Gateway as the EU’s external investment strategy, the EU has the power to lead this change.","Today at the opening of the Global Gateway Forum, President von der Leyen laid down her vision for strengthened partnerships in a radically changing global economy. With Global Gateway as the EU's external investment strategy, the EU has the power to lead this change. This determination is already delivering results and is outpacing its initial objectives. At the forum, the President announced that Team Europe – EU, Member States, and Development financing institutions - has mobilised over €306 billion in just four years, already meeting the target set in 2021. This was achieved two years ahead of the initial 2027 target.
European Commission President von der Leyen said: “With Global Gateway, Europe's investment strategy, we set an ambitious target of €300 billion by 2027. Along the way, it became clear that the world needs not just investments, but partnerships. Genuine partnerships based on respect, shared interests and long-term commitment. This is the essence and the success of Global Gateway. And today I am confident we will surpass €400 billion by 2027.”
The 2025 Global Gateway Forum, attended by 12 Heads of State and Government and over 70 Ministers from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, provides a unique platform to turn ideas into investment partnerships, and bring projects closer to their achievement.
In the current competitive and transactional environment, all countries face the same challenges: securing access to capital, resources and technology, reducing dangerous dependencies, and strengthening strategic autonomy. Against this background, the EU and partners countries must invest in diversification and reliable partnerships.
Today and throughout the Forum, President von der Leyen, together with High Representative Vice-President Kallas, Executive Vice-President Ribera, Commissioner Síkela, Commissioner Šuica and Commissioner Kos will echo a clear message: Team Europe is a reliable and transparent partner for strong partnerships based on values and shared interests, and this joint work delivers good results.
Global Gateway is Europe's offer to partner countries, delivering both on national, regional and global challenges, but also on the EU's strategic interests. For instance, the EU has mobilised over €2 billion to upgrade transport infrastructure along the Solidarity Lanes between Ukraine, Moldova, and Member States, helping Ukraine export goods such as grain to international markets. Further, the Lobito Corridor in Central Africa will link Angola's Atlantic coast with Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. By reducing transport times from 45 days to just one week, the project will improve regional integration, lower emissions, and unlock opportunities for local industries and communities.
Similar partnerships are being advanced worldwide, ranging from the digital transition in Colombia and regional electricity integration in Guatemala, to digital connectivity in the Middle East via the MEDUSA Submarine Optical Fibre Cable, water security via the the Aqaba-Amman Water Desalination, cultural heritage protection in Iraq, and clean energy projects in South Africa, Togo and Mauritania. They also include strategic port modernisation in Cabo Verde, as well as the development of new food and health value chains in Africa and the Caribbean.
At the Global Gateway Forum, tangible progress will be made with partners from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, EU's Neighbourhood and the MENA region to advance Global Gateway on several fronts and across continents. Leaders from countries such as the Angola, Armenia, Cabo Verde, Colombia, Grenada, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Mauritania, Rwanda, South Africa, will come together with key stakeholders from the private sector, civil society, thought leaders, financial institutions, and international organisations. Together, they will work to deepen cooperation and mobilise global investment in both hard and soft infrastructure, laying the groundwork for sustainable growth and resilience.
Commissioner for International Partnerships Jozef Síkela added: “The success of Global Gateway shows a growing demand for partnership with Europe, that is based on reliability, transparency, and mutual benefit. This is a great opportunity for Europe and at this year's Global Gateway Forum, together with our partners, we are turning that demand into action, identifying new opportunities, expanding our cooperation, and proving that when Europe and its partners work together, we deliver real impact for both sides.”
Over 150 top European companies are present at the Forum, alongside governments, development banks and export credit agencies. President von der Leyen stressed that public funds alone cannot meet the world's investment needs and highlighted Global Gateway's role in mobilising private capital. For this reason, the new Global Gateway Investment Hub will provide an entry point for companies looking for EU investment support through the Global Gateway in countries. Grants, concessional loans and guarantees are used to share risk and make projects viable for business.
On the second day of the Forum, a series of Scale-up Sessions on Global Gateway flagship projects will take place, gathering governments, financial institutions, and private sector leaders. These sessions will focus on concrete investment commitments across key sectors, including:
A cooperation agreement between the European Commission and the World Bank Group will also be signed at the Global Gateway Forum.
Global Gateway is the EU's external investment strategy to build smart, clean, and secure connections in the digital, energy, and transport sectors, as well as strengthen health, education and research systems globally. It fits the current geopolitical context by nurturing equal partnerships that increase strategic autonomy and resilience of Europe and partner countries alike. It is an attractive offer thanks to its sustainable investments. It is the EU's contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals beyond its borders.
With Global Gateway, Europe’s investment strategy, we set an ambitious target of €300 billion by 2027. Along the way, it became clear that the world needs not just investments, but partnerships. Genuine partnerships based on respect, shared interests and long-term commitment. This is the essence and the success of Global Gateway. And today I am confident we will surpass €400 billion by 2027.

Global Gateway Forum: the European Commission and World Bank Group deepen partnership for infrastructure and jobs,https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/global-gateway-forum-european-commission-and-world-bank-group-deepen-partnership-infrastructure-and-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"The European Commission, in line with its Global Gateway investment strategy, and the World Bank Group are deepening their strategic partnership to drive a new generation of connectivity projects.","The European Commission, in line with its Global Gateway investment strategy, and the World Bank Group are deepening their strategic partnership to drive a new generation of connectivity projects. An initial pipeline of projects includes 18 high-impact investments in three strategic sectors (energy, transport, and digital infrastructure) across Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean.
The collaboration, which will include regular high-level engagement and progress updates, is designed to ensure that projects move not only from pipeline to financing, but from financing to jobs, services, and results. The announcement was made in the margins of the Global Gateway Forum that takes place on 9 and 10 October in Brussels.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “Today, we are taking our partnership with the World Bank to the next level. This new framework will guide how we steer, govern, and monitor joint projects in the areas like energy, transport, and digital infrastructure. This will make sure that Global Gateway's strategic investments, hand in hand with the World Bank Group's capacity to deliver reforms, can crowd in maximum private capital.”
This partnership has objectives to create local jobs and drive sustainable economic growth, with a focus on building vibrant private sectors that create opportunity for local communities, especially in countries with abundant natural resources and large youth populations.
It advances the three pillars of the World Bank Group's job creation strategy: investing in human and physical foundations like education, healthcare, roads, ports, and electricity; fostering business-friendly environments with clear laws, predictable taxes, and transparent institutions; and supporting the private sector with capital, guarantees, and risk insurance.
It also complements a unique feature of the Global Gateway: in addition to investment in hard infrastructure for the long term built to the highest quality and environmental standards, Team Europe also provides regulatory support, skill development, training, research, and investment in local jobs and companies.
The 18 initial projects were chosen for their alignment with Global Gateway and World Bank Group priorities, along with their proven ability to scale, potential to attract private capital, and expected impact on jobs creation, productivity, and regional integration.

EU Ecolabel hits record numbers as green opportunities for businesses and consumers grow,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-ecolabel-hits-record-numbers-green-opportunities-grow-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"Italy tops the rankings in terms of products certified under the scheme, followed closely by Spain, France and Germany.","The EU Ecolabel has reached a historic milestone: more than 109,096 products now covered by 3,384 licences across Europe carry its trusted logo – the widest range of eco-friendly choices ever available under the scheme.
The EU Ecolabel is gaining momentum, offering new opportunities for businesses and greener choices for consumers. Since March 2025, certified products have increased by 7% (+6,723), while licences have grown by 4% (+136).
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a central role in the success of the EU Ecolabel. They make up 57% of all licence holders, showing that Europe’s green transition is being driven from the ground up.
With 97% of licences based in the European Economic Area, local businesses are turning sustainable ideas into tangible solutions that benefit both markets and the environment.
Some countries are emerging as clear leaders in EU Ecolabel certification. Italy tops the rankings with 17% of all certified products, followed by Spain (15%), France (12%) and Germany (9%).
Together, these four countries account for more than half of the EU Ecolabel’s presence across Europe, underlining their strong commitment to sustainable production and consumption.
At the same time, Denmark, Czechia, Portugal and Sweden are steadily expanding their eco-labelled offerings, confirming that demand for sustainable products is spreading across Europe.
The EU Ecolabel is now firmly visible in products used in daily life. Paints & varnishes are in the lead, with 38,096 certified products, followed by tissue paper & tissue products (20,253), textiles (11,067) and hard surface cleaning products (8,284).
Tourist accommodations remain the largest product group in terms of licences, representing 26% of all licences, with 901 certified establishments. Over the past six months, an additional 64 new licenses have joined the EU Ecolabel, further reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable tourism.
Alongside the progress, some categories, such as reusable menstrual cups, electronic displays and animal care products, are still underrepresented, leaving space for companies to meet new consumer needs while gaining a competitive edge through visibility and credibility.
Examples from pioneering companies show what this opportunity can look like in practice.
Kroll in Italy boosted its competitiveness by certifying nearly all its cosmetics, raising product value and opening doors to procurement (read more).
Chemi-Pharm in Estonia gained access to hospital tenders across Europe, with certified products now accounting for over 10% of its revenue (read more).
Drylock in Belgium turned the EU Ecolabel into a strategic asset in the hygiene sector, partnering with major retailers and reinforcing its leadership in circular innovation (read more).
These examples underline a simple message: the EU Ecolabel is helping companies compete more effectively, win procurement opportunities and build lasting trust with consumers.
With record-breaking figures and momentum still building, the scheme is proving that going green delivers business growth as well as environmental benefits.

Faster and safer instant euro payments become a reality,https://finance.ec.europa.eu/news/faster-and-safer-instant-euro-payments-become-reality-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,"People and businesses can now transfer money in euro within seconds, anytime – day or night, weekdays or weekends – whether within their own country or across the euro area.","From today, sending money across the euro area will be faster and safer than ever. Thanks to new EU rules on instant payments, people and businesses can now transfer money in euro within seconds, anytime – day or night, weekdays or weekends – whether within their own country or across the euro area.
Since January 2025, payment service providers (PSPs) in the euro area are obliged to offer their clients the possibility to receive euro instant payments. As of today, PSPs are also obliged to offer their clients the service of sending instant payments in euro and, in order to combat payment fraud in euro credit transfers, the service of payee verification (VoP). This makes instant payments more widely available, safer, and more affordable for everyone across the euro area.
Instant payments will boost Europe's economy and bring major benefits for citizens and companies. For citizens, money is available immediately, making it far easier to deal with emergencies or splitting bills in social settings. For companies, cash flow management will be improved, as will customer service: by providing an additional payment method to customers, they will save time and reduce costs.
What changes:
Next steps
From January 2027, payment service providers outside the euro area will also be required to allow their clients to send and receive instant payments in euro and verify the beneficiary.
The Commission will closely monitor how charges for instant payments evolve and whether there are any other outstanding obstacles to the availability and use of instant payments, and will report to the EU co-legislators to ensure that they remain affordable and accessible.
Background
The Instant Payments Regulation (March 2024) updates the 2012 rules on euro credit transfers to reflect technological progress and the needs of citizens and businesses today.
The rules have been rolled out gradually to ensure a smooth transition for payment service providers. Since 9 January 2025, PSPs in the euro area are prohibited from charging higher fees for instant payments than those applicable to regular transfers. Additionally, providers that do not yet offer instant payments in euro have had to make it possible for their clients to receive them.
For More Information
Link to Q&A on implementation of Instant Payments Regulation:
Link to Official Journal
Today marks a new era for payments in Europe. The Instant Payments Regulation will substantially improve the daily lives of our citizens and businesses by allowing them to send and receive payments instantaneously, round the clock. This will make transactions more secure, with payment service providers required to verify the intended beneficiary and send an alert to the payer in case of error or suspected fraud. We will monitor the concrete implementation in Member States so that everyone can fully benefit from these new rules

Commission provides new guidance to Member States on implementing Social Climate Fund,https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-provides-new-guidance-member-states-implementing-social-climate-fund-2025-10-09_en,9 October 2025,The European Commission has issued new guidance to help EU Member States effectively implement the Social Climate Fund (SCF) and complete their Social Climate Plans (SCPs).,"The European Commission has issued new guidance to help EU Member States effectively implement the Social Climate Fund (SCF) and complete their Social Climate Plans (SCPs).
Starting in 2026 and mobilising over €86 billion, the Social Climate Fund has been created to ensure the transition to a greener economy is fair and leaves no one behind and to support vulnerable households and small businesses in their efforts to switch to cleaner energy and transport. It will use the revenues from the new emissions trading system for fuel combustion in buildings, road transport and additional sectors (ETS2) to help vulnerable people, small businesses and transport users cope with the costs of the clean transition - especially in housing and transport.
Today’s guidance document builds on previous Commission guidance and technical assistance to Member States by setting out a series of principles for implementing the SCF. It also provides practical advice to help EU countries deliver their Social Climate Plans (necessary to access funding) and implement them effectively so that support swiftly reaches those exposed to energy or transport poverty and social fairness is guaranteed.
In addition, the integration of Social Climate Plans into National and Regional Partnership Plans will enable more targeted and effective investments, allowing Member States and regions to overcome their specific challenges. Furthermore, this new framework will streamline the use of EU funds, leading to more efficient implementation and a stronger focus on delivering the Fund's objectives.
The Social Climate Plans set a payout value for each measure and investment. Payments will happen once the milestones and targets are achieved.
SCF funds will only be disbursed when milestones and targets are fully met. This ensures payments are tied to actual results.
Member States can rely on existing structures already used for Cohesion Policy programmes and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), making implementation faster and simpler.
Member States should actively involve stakeholders, including regional and local authorities, social partners and civil society, to ensure the SCPs reflect needs on the ground.
Member States and the Commission will use a single digital system to track and report on all measures, investments and beneficiaries. This provides transparency, clarity and trust in how funds are used.
Member States must put in place strong safeguards to prevent, detect and address fraud, corruption, conflicts of interest, and double funding, protecting the integrity of SCF resources.
To receive funds under the Social Climate Fund, Member States have to incorporate the new ETS2 - legislation which is already in force - into national law. They must submit their Social Climate Plans to the Commission for approval, setting out their national measures and investments to support those most vulnerable. Once a plan is formally submitted, the Commission has up to five months to complete its assessment. Adopted plans will be announced by the Commission.
Member States will be able to submit their first payment request to the Commission as of 31 July 2026 provided they have implemented the approved plans and the agreed milestones and targets have been achieved.
The SCF is designed to bridge the current and next EU multi-annual financial framework (MFF). It draws on the lessons learned and best practices from the RRF and Cohesion Policy funds.
The Social Climate Fund will provide significant financial support to the Member States to finance measures and investments identified in the national Social Climate Plans.
Running from 2026 to 2032, the Fund is expected to mobilise at least €86.7 billion, combining ETS2 revenues and Member States’ contributions (at least 25% of the costs of their plans). The Fund will support the most vulnerable groups through structural measures and investments in energy efficiency, the renovation of buildings (e.g. insulation), clean heating and cooling (e.g. heat pumps), and integration of renewable energy (e.g. solar panels), as well as in zero- and low-emission mobility and transport, including public transport.
The Commission is working closely with Member States to facilitate the development of their Social Climate Plans and calls for their swift submission as the SCF kicks off one year before ETS2 starts operating in 2027. Two Member States (Sweden and Latvia) have formally submitted their plans to date and more than half of Member States have shared draft versions. In this process, the Commission has provided regular exchanges since 2023 through the Commission’s SCF expert group on climate change policy, and issued Guidance on the Social Climate Plans and technical guidance on the application of the Do No Significant Harm principle in March 2025."
Empowering women in security: EU and Iraq advance counter-terrorism intelligence,https://fpi.ec.europa.eu/news/empowering-women-security-eu-and-iraq-advance-counter-terrorism-intelligence-2025-10-08_en,8 October 2025,"Twenty-five Iraqi female officers strengthened their skills in counter-terrorism intelligence during a week-long training in Baghdad, Iraq.","Held at the Joint Coordination Center and hosted by the European Union Advisory Mission in Iraq (EUAM Iraq), the activity focused on operational intelligence tools (human (HUMINT), open source (OSINT), and geospatial (GEOINT)) used in investigations on foreign terrorist fighters.
CT JUST is an EU-funded programme that helps partner countries strengthen their ability to prevent and combat terrorism while upholding the rule of law and human rights.
The project supports national authorities in improving investigation techniques, judicial cooperation, and coordination between security and justice sectors. In Iraq, CT JUST works with security institutions to build counter-terrorism capacity, promote gender equality in law enforcement, and ensure that operational practices align with international standards and EU principles.
Developed in response to Iraqi authorities’ priorities, the course aimed to enhance the operational capacity of law enforcement units to apply modern intelligence techniques while respecting human rights and integrating a gender perspective.
Participants from several Iraqi state agencies, including the Ministry of Interior and the National Intelligence Service, took part in theoretical and practical sessions led by European experts from Spain, Belgium, and EUROPOL. The training covered a range of topics, from identity virtualisation and social media analysis to satellite imagery and data cross-referencing.
Major General Alaa Jaber Hasim of Iraq’s Ministry of Interior highlighted the programme’s added value for national capacity building, while EUAM Iraq’s Head of Security, Chief Commissioner Angelina Mezach, underlined its role in empowering women in law enforcement and promoting a safer society.
The activity forms part of the CT JUST project’s 2024–2026 bilateral cooperation cycle between the EU and Iraq, implemented under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP). It also supports the EU’s Gender Action Plan III and the Women, Peace and Security Agenda by promoting women’s professional development in security and counter-terrorism.
A follow-up module focusing on digital evidence and forensic methodologies is scheduled for later in 2025, continuing efforts to foster sustainable, gender-responsive technical cooperation between the EU and Iraq."
AI is a strategic tool to improve scientific research,https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/ai-strategic-tool-improve-scientific-research-2025-10-08_en,8 October 2025,JRC research shapes the EU approach to strengthen AI in science in Europe.,"The Commission publishes today “A European Strategy for Artificial Intelligence in Science Paving the way for the Resource for AI Science in Europe (RAISE)” to accelerate the adoption of AI by European scientists in all disciplines.
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) report “Role of Artificial Intelligence in Scientific Research - A Science for Policy, European Perspective” accompanies the Strategy, providing a detailed analysis on the use of AI in the scientific process and the landscape of AI in science. This report helps policymakers develop informed policies to unlock AI’s full potential for EU research and paves the way for informed investment decisions.
The JRC will lead the future AI Evaluation Hub, announced in the Strategy, to monitor and evaluate AI models and systems in strategic scientific fields.
The JRC studied the global distribution of AI players, including research institutes, government bodies and firms publishing scientific articles, filing for priority patents or having their core business in AI activities.
Until 2024, two in five global AI players had at least one research and innovation (R&I) activity, (i.e. had filed for a patent on AI or published a scientific article on the topic). The JRC finds that among the AI players with research activities, the EU has the biggest share of AI research players (13%, US 4%, China 1%).
To accelerate the uptake of AI in science, the JRC stresses the need for shared infrastructures and open science to ensure reproducibility, wider access, and trustworthiness.
While AI models are becoming more powerful and versatile, they also require significant resources for training and deployment. This makes investment in High-Performance Computing (HPC), AI Factories (ecosystems that foster innovation and collaboration) and open scientific data repositories essential to secure EU's position as a leader in AI research.
A larger use of AI in science would generate new requirements for specialised expertise among researchers. The JRC assessment on skills shows the need for “hybrid” (multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary) teams that combine expertise in engineering, computer sciences and AI with specific domain expertise. Policies should therefore focus on attracting, developing and retaining this interdisciplinary talent to ensure that human expertise remains central to the research process.
Researchers use AI to enhance search and discovery in science, leveraging its context-aware and semantic search capabilities to generate answers based on search results.
The JRC report finds that scientists employ AI tools in varied fields, tasks and disciplines, from engineering to life sciences and humanities to drive real, applicable innovations. This includes using AI tools to analyse proteins more efficiently in life-science research, an AI application proven particularly successful in medicine like more effective drug discovery.
Drawing on deep dives into AI technology for protein structure prediction, material discovery and computational humanities, JRC report showcases how AI is accelerating innovation and strengthening EU research.
Opportunities are emerging across the full scientific process, from data analysis to the generation of novel research hypotheses. By assessing their potential and impact, the report gathers invaluable insights to guide investments in crucial areas such as high-performance computing and open-science infrastructure. This research can thereby boost EU competitiveness at global leve
The EU Competitiveness compass, published in January 2025, and the Clean Industrial Deal, published in February 2025, emphasise the importance of circular economy in creating a more sustainable, resilient and competitive European industrial sector, that in turn supports the EU's climate goals, while promoting more efficient technologies and job creation.

October infringement package – key decisions on energy,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/october-infringement-package-key-decisions-energy-2025-10-08_en,8 October 2025,"In the list of October infringements, there is 1 energy-related letter of formal notice, 1 reasoned opinion and additional reasoned opinion, and 3 referrals to the Court of Justice.","In its regular package of infringement decisions, the European Commission pursues legal action against Member States for failing to comply with their obligations under EU law. These decisions, covering various sectors and EU policy areas, aim to ensure the proper application of EU law for the benefit of citizens and businesses.
In the list of October infringements, there is 1 energy-related letter of formal notice, 1 reasoned opinion and additional reasoned opinion, and 3 referrals to the Court of Justice.
The European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Bulgaria (INFR(2025)2161) and Croatia (INFR(2025)2162) for failing to submit their report on the implementation of Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 by 1 January 2025. Directive (EU) 2019/944 establishes common rules for the internal market for electricity within the EU, aiming to create a competitive, consumer-centered, flexible, and non-discriminatory EU electricity market. Compliance with its provisions is crucial to ensure a fair and integrated energy market across Member States. According to Article 5(9) of the Directive, all Member States were required to provide the Commission with reports on the implementation of Article 5 of the same Directive by 1 January 2025. Such reports detail the necessity and proportionality of public interventions in electricity pricing, including an assessment of progress towards achieving effective competition among electricity suppliers and transitioning to market-based prices. Bulgaria and Croatia have not yet submitted the required reports, thus failing to meet their reporting obligations under the Electricity Directive (EU) 2019/944. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Bulgaria and Croatia, which now have two months to respond and notify their reports. In the absence of a satisfactory response by these two Member States, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Today, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to Malta (INFR(2024)0239) and an additional reasoned opinion to Slovakia (INFR(2024)0252) for failing to fully transpose into national law the provisions of the revised Renewable Energy Directive related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The amending Directive (Directive (EU) 2023/2413, amending Directive (EU) 2018/2001) entered into force in November 2023 and certain provisions had to be transposed into national law by 1 July 2024. These provisions include measures to simplify and accelerate permitting procedures both for renewable energy projects and the infrastructure projects necessary to integrate the additional capacity into the electricity system. They also set clear time limits for permit-granting procedures targeted at specific technologies or types of projects, strengthen the role of the single contact point for applications and establish the presumption that renewable energy projects and related grid infrastructure are of overriding public interest. In September 2024, the Commission sent letters of formal notice to 26 Member States for failing to fully transpose the Directive into national law. In February 2025, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Slovakia for not notifying any transposition measures. After examining the transposition measures notified by Malta and Slovakia, the Commission concluded that Malta has not yet fully transposed the Directive and Slovakia has not yet provided clear and precise information on how it has transposed the Directive. The Commission is therefore sending a reasoned opinion to Malta and an additional reasoned opinion to Slovakia, which now have two months to respond and complete the transposition. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions.
Today, the European Commission decided to refer Sweden (INFR(2024)0249) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to fully transpose into national law the provisions of the revised Renewable Energy Directive related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The amending Directive (Directive (EU) 2023/2413, amending Directive (EU) 2018/2001) entered into force in November 2023 and certain provisions had to be transposed into national law by 1 July 2024. These provisions include measures to simplify and accelerate permitting procedures both for renewable energy projects and for the infrastructure projects which are necessary to integrate the additional capacity into the electricity system. They also include clear time limits for permit-granting procedures targeted to specific technologies or types of projects, the strengthening of the role of the single contact point for applications and the presumption that renewable energy projects and the related grid infrastructure are of overriding public interest.  The Commission sent Sweden a letter of formal notice in September 2024 and a reasoned opinion in February 2025 for not having notified any transposition measures. Sweden has not yet notified any transposition measures. The Commission is therefore referring Sweden to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions. More information is in the press release.
Today, the European Commission decided to refer Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to submit its final updated integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) in line with the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. Under Article 14(2) of the Governance Regulation, all Member States are obliged to submit their final updated NECPs by 30 June 2024, taking into account the Commission's recommendations and individual assessments. Poland submitted its draft plan and the Commission published the corresponding assessment in April 2024, including recommendations on where the country should raise its ambitions in line with EU targets for 2030. Following the non-submission of the final plan, the Commission contacted the Member State in a pre-infringement dialogue in July 2024. The Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Poland in November 2024. In March 2025, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion still in the absence of the final plan. Having failed to submit its final updated NECP, the Commission considers that Poland has not complied with its legal obligation and is referring it to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  More information is in the press release.
Today, the European Commission decided to refer Poland (INFR(2022)2089) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to submit its national long-term strategy in line with the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. All EU Member States are obliged to submit their national long-term strategies defining a coherent national plan and vision for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the EU's climate neutrality objective by 2050 and its commitments under the Paris Agreement by 1 January 2020, as set out under Article 15(1) of the EU Governance Regulation. In September 2022, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Poland for failure to comply with its obligation under the EU Governance Regulation. This was followed up with a reasoned opinion in November 2023. Until now, Poland has not submitted its national long-term strategy and it is the only EU Member State that has not yet done so. The Commission considers Poland as not having complied yet with its legal obligation and is therefore referring the Member State to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in the press release.

Unprecedented Amazon fires in 2024 fuel record CO₂ emissions,https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/unprecedented-amazon-fires-2024-fuel-record-co2-emissions-2025-10-08_en,8 October 2025,"Wildfires burn area larger than Belgium, sending an equivalent of Germany’s annual emissions into the atmosphere.","The Amazon rainforest in 2024 suffered its most devastating forest fire season in over two decades, triggering roughly the annual emissions of Germany, a new JRC study finds. The estimated 791 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂) released into the atmosphere mark a sevenfold increase from the average of the previous two years.
The study, published today in Biogeosciences, finds that 3.3 million hectares of Amazon forest was impacted by fires last year alone. This area was larger than Belgium and represents 0.7% of Amazon’s remaining intact forest. It is the largest share of Amazon forest hit by fires since 2021 and nine times bigger than the average in more than 20 years.
This extraordinary surge in wildfires is likely driven by a combination of extreme drought stress due to global warming, forest fragmentation, and unsustainable land management leading to significant forest degradation. The unprecedented amount of both burned forest and the resulting carbon emissions expose the region’s growing ecological fragility despite a slowing deforestation.
The escalating frequency and extent of fires threaten to push the Amazon rainforest closer to a catastrophic tipping point. The study highlights the urgency of taking coordinated action to mitigate these drivers and prevent irreversible ecosystem damage.
It lists actions such as reducing fire use, strengthening law enforcement, and supporting local and Indigenous stewardship efforts. In addition, the authors highlight the need for enhanced international climate mitigation finance mechanisms that recognise and address forest degradation, not just deforestation.
The work carried out by JRC scientists is part of a wider cooperation between the EU and Latin America countries in the scope of the EU Amazonia+ program and a contribution to EU efforts in the fight against climate change, including the development of methods to benchmark the monitoring of forest resources and carbon emissions globally. The results of the study can help national authorities in the pan-Amazon region to improve national capacities to prevent, reduce and manage forest fires from a regional perspective, relying on EU best practices.
The analysis relied on combining data from two JRC-developed tools: the Global Wildfire Information System and the Tropical Moist Forest monitoring system. The latter pinpoints forest areas affected by fires and leaves out land areas used in deforestation activity or already deforested land.
To assess emissions and the related uncertainties across variables such as above-ground biomass density, combustion completeness, and the percentage of forest cover affected by fire, the authors applied a Monte Carlo simulation framework, an approach using computer modelling to obtain numerical results from random sampling.
Most of the forests affected by the fires are in Brazil (50%) and Bolivia (42%), followed by Venezuela (4.9%) and Peru (1.5%). In Brazil, 2024 marked the highest level of emissions from forest degradation on record. In Bolivia, fires affected over 9% of the country’s remaining intact forest cover, which is a dramatic blow to a region that has historically served as a vital biodiversity reservoir and carbon sink.
While past studies have highlighted the dangers of deforestation, this work sheds light on a more insidious threat: fire-driven degradation that erodes forest integrity without necessarily resulting in the complete clearing of the forest. Degraded forests may look intact from above, but they lose a significant portion of their biomass and ecological function. Unlike clear-cut areas, these degraded forests often are missed by national accounting systems and international policy frameworks.
The EU has a long-standing cooperation with the countries of Latin America through association and trade agreements, political and cooperation dialogues. Support to wildfire management in the region aims to reduce the impact of wildfires in the Amazon and neighbouring countries in cooperation with national authorities and international organisations.
Specifically, the Amazonia + programme – led by the Commission’s Directorate-General for International Partnerships – aims to improve the capacity of the countries of the Amazon basin to mitigate carbon emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change, significantly reduce deforestation and forest degradation and improve their biodiversity.

Next Generation EU drives sustainable growth across the EU,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/next-generation-eu-drives-sustainable-growth-across-eu-2025-10-08_en,8 October 2025,"As the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) approaches its 2026 deadline, it continues to drive positive reforms and investments across the EU.","As the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) approaches its 2026 deadline, it continues to drive positive reforms and investments across the EU. As a cornerstone of NextGenerationEU, the RRF has already disbursed €367 billion across Member States, contributing to key objectives such as economic and social resilience, and the green and digital transitions. Today, the Commission presents its fourth annual report, underscoring the Facility's progress and calling for action to maximize its benefits.
Building a resilient future
The report published today shows that the RRF has enhanced public investment – expected to rise to 3.8% of GDP in 2025, up from 3.2% in 2019 – for instance by supporting the decarbonisation and digitalisation of industrial production and services, or deploying over 900,000 clean vehicle recharging stations and connecting 16 million households to high-speed internet.
The Facility has also supported a wide range of structural reforms, also aimed at boosting long-term growth and economic and social resilience. They include speeding up planning and permitting, digitalising public services, addressing labour market vulnerabilities or enhancing quality of education across Member States.
The combination of reforms and investments has helped to maximise their impact and has led to improvements in public services and the business environment, as well as the quality of life for citizens in areas such as healthcare, education or infrastructure.
A win for all EU Member States
In addition to its positive impact on production and employment in each Member State, the RRF generates strong spillover effects across borders. When demand rises in one Member State, it fuels demand for imports from other Member States, supporting growth and employment throughout the EU. All Member States benefit, and for some, the overall economic impact is more than double the size of their national RRF envelope thanks to these cross-border spillovers. This reflects the deep economic integration within the EU.
Protecting EU financial interests
Protecting the financial interests of the Union remains central in the RRF implementation. The Commission continued to constructively engage with the European Court of Auditors (ECA) over the last year, swiftly acting on its recommendations. While conducting its own audits, the Commission supported the ECA's scrutiny on all grant payments and several RRF-related performance audits. Drawing on its audit findings, the Commission has strengthened audits and reinforced controls to ensure transparency and accountability.
Accelerated implementation remains a priority
The pace of implementation differs among Member States. With the RRF coming to an end in 2026 (a total financial envelope of €650 billion), the Commission urges them to accelerate the implementation of their Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRPs). Member States must meet all milestones and targets by 31 August 2026, with the Commission making the final payments by 31 December 2026. In its June Communication NextGenerationEU – The Road to 2026, the Commission provided guidance to support Member States in planning ahead for the submission of the last payment requests in 2026, emphasising the importance of streamlining and simplifying RRPs. By ensuring that the measures in the plans are clear and implementable, Member States can deliver on the agreed objectives without compromising on the plans' ambition. In this context, the Commission is currently reviewing a number of payment requests and revised RRPs submitted by several Member States.
Background
This report is the fourth in a series of annual publications on the implementation of the RRF, in line with the requirements of Article 31 of the RRF Regulation.
The cut-off date for all data and information included in this report is 31 August 2025, unless otherwise specified. Progress in the implementation of recovery and resilience plans can be followed on the Recovery and Resilience Scoreboard. You can explore the list of the 100 largest RRF funds recipients online.

The RRF plays a key role in making Europe’s economies and societies stronger and more competitive. As we enter the final phase, the Commission remains fully committed to working closely with Member States to further streamline their RRPs, identify suitable options for revision, and plan ahead for the submission of the final payment requests in 2026. The overarching objective is to simplify both the implementation and assessment of the RRPs, ensuring that every effort is made to deliver high-quality outcomes
The RRF keeps delivering for citizens and business in Europe. Hundreds of reforms and investments are helping companies to access better infrastructure, modernise their business models and tap into new opportunities. In turn, millions of citizens are benefitting from more accessible public services, such as improved healthcare facilities or supportive educational programmes. This fourth annual report presents an overview of progress in the delivery of RRF objectives. It is thus an important part of the Commission’s commitment to transparency in the implementation of the RRF.

This year’s three-day workshop, attended by over 100 participants, explored ways to improve the quality and reliability of astrometric and radar observations of NEOs, i.e. space rocks approaching the Earth or entering the atmosphere of the Earth.
Over the course of six sessions, participants learned about orbit determination and uncertainty propagation, astrometric observations and timing precision, radar observations and integration in astrometric pipelines, synthetic tracking and AI-based techniques, non-traditional astrometry such as occultations, Gaia, and space-based assets, as well as prospects for future radar facilities.
Participants then formulated suggestions, guidelines, and actions for improving the robustness of observational data used for NEOs to make sure that high-quality astrometric and radar data for timely and accurate impact risk assessments are available in the future.
Background
NEO is a subcomponent of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) component of the EU Space Programme. It aims at coordinating and improving European capabilities and activities related to the monitoring of space rocks whose orbits approach or cross the Earth's orbit.
To this end, the EU supports activities that map Member States' capabilities to detect and monitor NEOs, promote networking among Member States' facilities and research centres through a yearly conference, develop a European catalogue of physical properties of NEOs, and develop a routine rapid response service that can characterize newly detected NEOs.
This workshop is an ESA deliverable as part of its Contribution Agreement with DG DEFIS in the implementation of the NEO subcomponent of the EU Space Programme."
OLAF and EUIPO unite with global partners in the fight against e-commerce fakes,https://anti-fraud.ec.europa.eu/media-corner/news/olaf-and-euipo-unite-global-partners-fight-against-e-commerce-fakes-2025-10-08_en,8 October 2025,"The European Anti-Fraud Office and the European Union Intellectual Property Office hosted the international conference “Ordered, counterfeited, unmasked: the global fight against e-commerce fakes” on 7–8 October in Alicante, Spain.","Press release no 25/2025PDF version
The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) hosted the international conference “Ordered, counterfeited, unmasked: the global fight against e-commerce fakes” on 7–8 October in Alicante, Spain. The event, the largest ever organised jointly by OLAF and EUIPO, brought together over 100 participants from across the world to address one of the fastest-growing fraud phenomena: counterfeit products sold online.
OLAF and national customs authorities presented trends, case studies and investigative techniques for online investigations. Experts discussed methods used by counterfeiters to misuse online sales channels and shared best practices on how to tackle them. Major e-commerce platforms explained the operation of traditional websites and e-commerce platforms, their various business models and logistic flows as well as compliance processes related to the prevention of online sale of counterfeited products.
E-commerce has revolutionised shopping but it has also created a fertile ground for fraudsters to push fake and unsafe goods into the market. Counterfeit goods cause economic harm but can also pose serious risks to consumers’ health and safety. The rapid growth of online platforms, combined with the anonymity and speed of digital transactions, makes tackling this wrongdoing a uniquely complex challenge.
For this reason, for the first time, the conference was organised in a hybrid format, allowing wide reach of partners from all continents. The conference brought together more than 100 participants from across the world, including over 50 customs authorities. Speakers from Belgium, Brazil, India, Nigeria, Türkiye and Sweden animated the discussions. Major e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Alibaba, Mercado Libre, Temu and Shopee, alongside payment provider PayPal and representatives from World Customs Organization (WCO) also took part. Their presence reflected the global nature of e-commerce fraud and the need for global solutions. You can read more about the event in EUIPO's news item.
OLAF acting Director-General Salla Saastamoinen stressed the importance of the event: “E-commerce has revolutionised shopping, but it has also created new opportunities for fraudsters. Counterfeit toys, medicines and electronics are not harmless bargains — they endanger health and safety. With this conference, OLAF and EUIPO laid the groundwork for stronger international cooperation to protect consumers in Europe and worldwide.”
The two-day meeting marked a turning point by moving beyond knowledge-sharing to creating the basis for future operational collaboration. OLAF and EUIPO intend this to be the start of enhanced global joint efforts against online counterfeiting, ensuring that the digital marketplace becomes safer and fairer for citizens.
OLAF mission, mandate and competences:OLAF’s mission is to detect, investigate and stop fraud with EU funds.
OLAF fulfils its mission by:•    carrying out independent investigations into fraud and corruption involving EU funds, so as to ensure that all EU taxpayers’ money reaches projects that can create jobs and growth in Europe;•    contributing to strengthening citizens’ trust in the EU Institutions by investigating serious misconduct by EU staff and members of the EU Institutions;•    developing a sound EU anti-fraud policy.
In its independent investigative function, OLAF can investigate matters relating to fraud, corruption and other offences affecting the EU financial interests concerning:•    all EU expenditure: the main spending categories are Structural Funds, agricultural policy and rural development funds, direct expenditure and external aid;•    some areas of EU revenue, mainly customs duties;•    suspicions of serious misconduct by EU staff and members of the EU institutions.
Once OLAF has completed its investigation, it is for the competent EU and national authorities to examine and decide on the follow-up of OLAF’s recommendations. All persons concerned are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a competent national or EU court of law.

Commission proposes safeguards to strengthen protections for EU farmers in EU-Mercosur deal,https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-proposes-safeguards-strengthen-protections-eu-farmers-eu-mercosur-deal-2025-10-08_en,8 October 2025,The Commission today proposed a Regulation to strengthen protections for EU farmers in the context of the EU-Mercosur Partnership Agreement (EMPA).,"The Commission today proposed a Regulation to strengthen protections for EU farmers in the context of the EU-Mercosur Partnership Agreement (EMPA). The proposed safeguards deliver on the guarantees provided to EU farmers under the EMPA legal proposal, sent to EU Member States by the Commission on 3 September. In practice, they provide an additional layer of certainty to EU farmers beyond the carefully calibrated phase-in of targeted quotas that have been agreed with Mercosur for imports in sensitive sectors. In the unlikely event of an unforeseen and harmful surge in imports from Mercosur or an undue decrease in prices for EU producers, swift and effective protections would kick into gear.
The proposal lays down procedures to guarantee the timely and effective implementation of bilateral safeguard measures for agricultural products. It also includes specific provisions as regards certain sensitive agricultural products  (listed in the Annex to the regulation) such as beef, poultry, rice, honey, eggs, garlic, ethanol, and sugar.
The specific provisions for sensitive products include enhanced monitoring, clear triggers, and rapid response.
Enhanced monitoring
The Commission will systematically monitor market trends regarding the imports of certain sensitive agricultural products under the agreement. On the basis of these results, the Commission will send a report to the Council and the European Parliament every six months assessing the impacts of these imports on the EU markets.
This regular and granular monitoring will allow the identification of any risks at an early stage, and swift action to remedy potential negative impacts. Such reports shall cover the Union market and, if relevant, also cover the specific situation in one or several Member States.
Clear triggers
The Commission will examine, as a matter of priority, cases where there is a surge of imports or a decrease in domestic prices concentrated in one or several Member States.
As a rule, the Commission will launch an investigation if import prices from Mercosur are at least 10% lower than prices of the same or competing EU products and there is a) a more than 10% increase in annual imports of a product from Mercosur under preferential terms or b) a 10% decrease in the import prices of that given product from Mercosur, all compared to the preceding year. If the investigation concludes that there is serious injury (or threat thereof), the EU could temporarily withdraw tariffs preferences on products causing injury.
Rapid Response
Under the proposal, the Commission commits to:
Background
The bilateral safeguard clauses included in the EMPA allow for the temporary withdrawal of tariff preferences to counteract possible negative impacts of tariff reductions. Today's proposal translates this clause directly into binding and immediately enforceable EU law.
It builds on the Regulation (EU) 2019/287 which implements the safeguard clause and other mechanisms allowing for the temporary withdrawal of preferences in certain agreements concluded between the European Union and certain third countries. Given the sensitivities related to trade in agricultural goods with Mercosur countries, a specific legal act was deemed appropriate.
Next steps
The Regulation proposed today by the Commission will need to be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in an ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission has demonstrated rapid action in proposing this regulation, and we anticipate that the co-legislators will swiftly adopt it so to immediately profit from it.
For More Information
Promoting the economic competitiveness and societal importance of our farmers will always be the EU trade agenda’s top priority. On the one hand, we must continue finding new export opportunities worldwide for their peerless products. On the other hand, we must provide all necessary protections to our farmers in the context of certain trade deals. These safeguards embody that core principle. We have listened to our farmers, we have reflected, and now we have acted – in their interest. We believe that with this cast-iron legal guarantee, our farmers can now support the Mercosur deal with confidence, and we trust the co-legislators will now treat this proposal as a priority, so that the regulation can be adopted ahead of the signature of the EU-Mercosur agreement.
The safeguards we are attaching to the EU-Mercosur deal are unprecedented. With today’s proposal, the EU agri-food sector can be confident that the Commission will always be on their side. In view of the concerns expressed, it was necessary to add an extra layer of protection, which is what we are doing now. We have heard the farmers’ concerns, and we are acting on it. The Commission will be ready to act swiftly and decisively in case of need to protect the interests of our agri-food sector. I will also travel to Brazil with a delegation of EU producers at the end of October to promote our exports in this great market. We want our producers to benefit from this deal, as much as all other sectors in our economies, without feeling threatened by it.

Letters of formal notice and additional letter of formal notice
Commission calls on BELGIUM and MALTA to comply with waste management requirements  The European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending letters of formal notice to Belgium (INFR(2025)2129) and Malta (INFR(2025)2131) for failing to comply with the Landfill Directive (Directive 1999/31/EC) as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/850). The Landfill Directive sets standards for landfills to prevent adverse effects on human health, water, soil and air. Under this Directive, Member States must take measures to ensure that only waste that has been subject to treatment is landfilled. This should include, as a minimum, an adequate selection of the different waste streams and the pre-treatment of the organic fraction of waste. Regarding Belgium, the grievances concern the transposition of rules in Flanders, such as the exclusions from landfilling. Furthermore, the calculation rules for attaining the landfill target are insufficiently clear and precise, and the exemptions on testing of compliance of the waste to be landfilled are not in line with the Directive. Regarding Malta, landfilled waste at certain sites is not subject to an adequate selection of waste streams prior to landfilling. Annual municipal waste generated per capita was higher in Malta than in most EU countries, and landfilling is still the predominant waste treatment option with a low recycling rate. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Belgium and Malta, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions.
Commission calls on ESTONIA and AUSTRIA to correctly transpose the Drinking Water Directive  The European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice to Estonia (INFR(2025)2122) and Austria (INFR(2025)2120) for failing to correctly transpose the Drinking Water Directive (Directive (EU) 2020/2184), which contributes to improving water resilience across the EU and achieving the EU's zero pollution ambition. The recast Drinking Water Directive further protects human health by updating water quality standards, tackling pollutants of concern, such as endocrine disruptors and microplastics, and providing rules for cleaner tap water. Member States were required to transpose the Directive into national law and comply with its provisions by 12 January 2023. The conformity checks of national legislations have revealed instances of non-conform transposition in both Member States. As regards Estonia, the transposition issues concern measures to be taken in case of potential danger to human health from drinking water, the conformity of materials in contact with drinking water and the risk-based approach obligations. Regarding Austria, transposition issues concern general obligations and quality standards in one of the Austrian Länder (Carinthia). Other shortcomings concern the transposition of the rules on risk assessment and risk management of the catchment areas, the supply system, the domestic distribution system and monitoring. In addition, national rules do not in all cases require operators to provide information on-line to consumers. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Estonia and Austria, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of satisfactory responses, the Commission may decide to issue reasoned opinions.
Commission calls on POLAND to bring its national legislation in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive and the Habitats DirectiveThe European Commission decided to issue an additional letter of formal notice to Poland (INFR(2019)2024) for failing to correctly transpose the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (Directive 2011/92/EU as amended by Directive 2014/52/EU) and the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC). Under the EIA Directive, major projects must first be assessed regarding their impact on the environment. There are also strict rules about informing the public and ensuring that the public can challenge EIA decisions before the courts. Similar but distinct requirements exist under the Habitats Directive for assessing the impact of plans and projects on Natura 2000 sites. To date, Poland's legislation is not in line with some of the EIA Directive's provisions. The Commission therefore sent a letter of formal notice in March 2019. Since then, some issues have been rectified. However, certain shortcomings remain. For example, the Polish law still excludes deep drillings of minerals from the obligation to undergo at least a screening procedure which would allow to decide whether an EIA is necessary. Furthermore, contrary to the EIA and Habitats Directives, the Polish law does not allow environmental organisations to challenge before courts the so-called negative screening decisions (decisions not to carry out an EIA or an assessment of the project's impact on Natura 2000 sites). The Commission is therefore sending an additional letter of formal notice to Poland. Poland now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to send a reasoned opinion.
Reasoned opinions
Commission calls on PORTUGAL to correctly transpose the Medium Combustion Plants Directive The European Commission decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Portugal (INFR(2024)2224) for not fully transposing the Medium Combustion Plants Directive (MCPD) (Directive 2015/2193/EC). The Directive aims at further reducing air pollution by setting emission limit values for medium combustion plants. These plants are an important source of air pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust. Respecting EU rules on emission limit values is key to effectively protect human health and safeguard the natural environment. The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Portugal in December 2024, for not having correctly transposed into national legislation several provisions of the MCPD. In its reply to the letter of formal notice, Portugal agreed to amend the legislation to address some of the issues raised. However, other issues remain such as those relating to exemptions, information to be provided by the operator, monitoring of emissions, obligations imposed on the operator and information available to the competent authority. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Portugal, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Commission calls on the NETHERLANDS to correctly transpose the Waste Framework Directive The European Commission decided to issue a reasoned opinion to the Netherlands (INFR(2023)2161) for failing to correctly transpose the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC) as amended by Directive 2018/851/EU into national legislation. The Waste Framework Directive is the EU's framework legislation aiming to prevent or reduce the generation of waste, reducing overall impacts of resource use and improving the efficiency of such use, which is crucial for the transition to a circular economy and for guaranteeing the Union's long-term competitiveness. The amended Directive sets binding targets for recycling and preparing municipal waste for reuse. It also introduces requirements for Member States to improve their waste management systems and the efficiency of resource use. The deadline for Member States to transpose the amended Directive into their national legislation was 5 July 2020. The Netherlands has not correctly transposed several provisions of the amended Directive including points concerning the general minimum requirements for extended producer responsibility schemes. The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Netherlands in December 2023. In its reply of April 2024, the Netherlands committed to amending its national legislation to ensure full compliance with the Directive. However, so far, this has not been completed. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to the Netherlands, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Letter of formal notice and additional letter of formal notice
Commission calls on BELGIUM to ensure public authorities pay for goods and services on time and that recovery compensation is paid automaticallyToday the European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Belgium (INFR(2025)2130) for failing to fulfil its obligations under the Late Payment Directive (Directive 2011/7/EU). Late payments negatively impact businesses by reducing liquidity, hindering growth, and weakening resilience.  According to the Commission, several Belgian public administrations, including the Federal Government, Flemish municipalities, and the Brussels-Capital Region, have been paying suppliers later than the maximum time limits set out in the Late Payment Directive (30 days or 60 days for entities providing healthcare). In addition, they have not been paying the fixed EUR 40 recovery compensation required under the rules for late payment. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Belgium, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Commission calls on ITALY to comply with EU rules on Public Procurement The European Commission decided to send a third additional letter of formal notice to Italy (INFR(2018)2273) for failing to correctly transpose into national legislation certain provisions of the EU Public Procurement Directives (Directive 2014/23/EU, Directive 2014/24/EU and Directive 2014/25/EU). EU public procurement legislation requires public contracts above a certain threshold to be put out to tender, respecting the principles of transparency, equal treatment, free competition and non-discrimination. In ensuring that Member States correctly transpose these directives into their national legislations, the Commission acts to protect fair competition, to make it easier and cheaper for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to bid for public contracts, and to promote better value for taxpayers' money. The Commission considers that the new rules on project financing award procedures and on the disclosure of technical and commercial secrets related to bids in tenders, set out in the Italian Public Procurement Code adopted in April 2023 and amended in December 2024, still fail to comply with EU Public Procurement Directives. The Commission is therefore sending this additional letter of formal notice to Italy, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Reasoned opinion
Commission calls on CROATIA to ensure free movement of services for lawyers and law firms  The European Commission has decided to send a reasoned opinion to Croatia (INFR(2023)2189) for restricting disproportionately the freedom of establishment and free movement of services for EU lawyers and law firms in breach of the Services Directive (Directive 2006/123/EC) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The objective of the Services Directive is to realise the full potential of services markets in Europe by removing legal and administrative barriers, while at the same time allowing for national safeguards which are justified and proportionate to their pursued objective. The Commission considers that the Croatian law breaches EU rules by prohibiting EU law firms from setting up subsidiaries - while Croatian law firms may do so -, by only allowing lawyers to work in one law firm, by imposing excessively high and indirectly discriminatory Bar registration fees, and by placing disproportionate restrictions on commercial communications. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Croatia, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Letters of formal notice
Commission calls on BULGARIA, DENMARK, FRANCE and CYPRUS to correctly transpose the provisions of the Firearms Directive   The European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice to Bulgaria (INFR(2025)2155), Denmark  (INFR(2025)2157), France (INFR(2025)2158) and Cyprus (INFR(2025)2156), for failing to correctly transpose the provisions of the Firearms Directive (Directive (EU) 2021/555). The Firearms Directive sets common minimum standards on the acquisition, possession, and commercial exchange of civilian firearms, for example firearms used for sport shooting and hunting. The Directive keeps high standards of security and protection against criminal acts and illicit trafficking of firearms. The Commission is sending letters of formal notice to Bulgaria, Denmark, France and Cyprus which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Reasoned opinions
Commission issues reasoned opinion to BELGIUM, GERMANY, ESTONIA, SPAIN and POLAND for failure to fully transpose the Directive on Information exchange between law enforcement authoritiesToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to Belgium, (INFR(2025)0006), Germany, (INFR(2025)0029), Estonia, (INFR(2025)0038), Spain (INFR(2025)0049) and Poland (INFR(2025)0087) for failing to fully transpose the Directive on information exchange between law enforcement authorities of Member States (Directive 2023/977). The Directive aims to strengthen the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences in the EU, by ensuring that police officers in one Member State have equivalent access to the information available to those in another Member State. It sets out the organisational and procedural rules on the information sharing between the law enforcement authorities of EU Member States, including the establishment of a single point of contact, acting as a ‘one-stop shop' for information exchange with other EU Member States. The Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Spain and Poland, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial penalties.
Commission calls on BULGARIA, IRELAND and SPAIN and to correctly transpose the provisions of the Child Sexual Abuse DirectiveToday, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to Bulgaria (INFR(2019)2136), Ireland (INFR(2019)2235) and Spain (INFR(2018)2197) for failure to correctly transpose into national law the Directive 2011/93/EU on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The EU has strict rules criminalising child sexual abuse, child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse material across Europe. The Directive includes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions, and introduces provisions to strengthen the prevention of those crimes and the protection of child victims. The Directive also requires Member States to ensure that effective intervention programmes or measures are made available to offenders. In the absence of a correct transposition of all these rules, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to these three Member States, which now have two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Commission calls on PORTUGAL to correctly transpose EU rules on price reductions in relation to servicesThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Portugal (INFR(2025)2154) for failing to correctly transpose the rules on price reductions provided in the Modernisation Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/2161)). This Directive amends four directives: the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the Consumer Rights Directive, the Unfair Contract Terms Directive, and the Price Indication Directive. It aims to ensure a high level of protection for consumers while harmonising national rules for the benefit of the internal market. The Commission considers that Portuguese national provisions transposing the amendments of the Price Indication Directive go beyond its scope, covering not only movable goods, as required by the Price Indication Directive, but also services. Portugal therefore does not comply with the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which covers all commercial practices, including announcements of price reductions for services, and prohibits Member States from adopting stricter rules that exceed its requirements. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Portugal, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Commission calls on CZECHIA to correctly transpose EU rules on free movement of personsThe European Commission decided to send an additional letter of formal notice to Czechia (INFR(2011)2077) for failing to transpose the rules on free movement of EU citizens and their family members (Directive 2004/38/EC). The Commission sent a first letter of formal notice in 2011 and a reasoned opinion in 2012, following which Czechia resolved all but one of the grievances raised by the Commission. However, over the years, new shortcomings in Czechia's transposition and implementation of EU rules on free movement of EU citizens and their family members have emerged. The Commission has therefore decided to send an additional letter of formal notice to Czechia to address the one remaining issue from the original infringement case, as well as several additional concerns. These grievances include, for example, limitations on the rights that EU citizens and their family members may enjoy in Czechia, such as excessive requirements, unjustified difference in treatment, and shortcomings in relation to restrictions of rights. Czechia now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Reasoned opinion
Commission calls on SLOVAKIA to transpose the European Accessibility Act The European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to Slovakia (INFR(2022)0326) for failing to fully transpose into national law the European Accessibility Act (Directive (EU) 2019/88) on accessibility of products and services for persons with disabilities). Adopted in 2019, the European Accessibility Act requires key products and services, such as phones, computers, e-books, banking services and electronic communications, to be accessible for persons with disabilities. This will help increase active participation in society, including in education and in employment, as well as increase autonomy and mobility opportunities of persons with disabilities, representing more than 100 million European citizens. The deadline for Member States to transpose the Directive was 28 June 2022 and economic operators had to ensure that they comply with the set of common EU accessibility requirements laid down in the Act by 28 June 2025. The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Slovakia on 22 July 2022 for failing to communicate complete transposition measures. Although Slovakia communicated some more transposition measures, the Commission considered that there are still some transposition gaps. Therefore, the Commission has decided to issue a reasoned opinion to Slovakia, which now has two months to respond and take the necessary measures. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer their case to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial penalties.

Commission calls BULGARIA and CROATIA to fulfil their reporting obligations under the internal market rules for electricityThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Bulgaria (INFR(2025)2161) and Croatia (INFR(2025)2162) for failing to submit their report on the implementation of Article 5 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 by 1 January 2025. Directive (EU) 2019/944 establishes common rules for the internal market for electricity within the EU, aiming to create a competitive, consumer-centered, flexible, and non-discriminatory EU electricity market. Compliance with its provisions is crucial to ensure a fair and integrated energy market across Member States. According to Article 5(9) of the Directive, all Member States were required to provide the Commission with reports on the implementation of Article 5 of the same Directive by 1 January 2025. Such reports detail the necessity and proportionality of public interventions in electricity pricing, including an assessment of progress towards achieving effective competition among electricity suppliers and transitioning to market-based prices. Bulgaria and Croatia have not yet submitted the required reports, thus failing to meet their reporting obligations under the Electricity Directive (EU) 2019/944. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Bulgaria and Croatia, which now have two months to respond and notify their reports. In the absence of a satisfactory response by these two Member States, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Reasoned opinion and additional reasoned opinion
Commission urges MALTA and SLOVAKIA to fully transpose EU rules accelerating permitting procedures for renewable energy projects Today, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to Malta (INFR(2024)0239) and an additional reasoned opinion to Slovakia (INFR(2024)0252) for failing to fully transpose into national law the provisions of the revised Renewable Energy Directive related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The amending Directive (Directive (EU) 2023/2413, amending Directive (EU) 2018/2001) entered into force in November 2023 and certain provisions had to be transposed into national law by 1 July 2024. These provisions include measures to simplify and accelerate permitting procedures both for renewable energy projects and the infrastructure projects necessary to integrate the additional capacity into the electricity system. They also set clear time limits for permit-granting procedures targeted at specific technologies or types of projects, strengthen the role of the single contact point for applications and establish the presumption that renewable energy projects and related grid infrastructure are of overriding public interest. In September 2024, the Commission sent letters of formal notice to 26 Member States for failing to fully transpose the Directive into national law. In February 2025, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Slovakia for not notifying any transposition measures. After examining the transposition measures notified by Malta and Slovakia, the Commission concluded that Malta has not yet fully transposed the Directive and Slovakia has not yet provided clear and precise information on how it has transposed the Directive. The Commission is therefore sending a reasoned opinion to Malta and an additional reasoned opinion to Slovakia, which now have two months to respond and complete the transposition. Otherwise, the Commission may decide to refer the cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions.
Referrals to the Court of Justice
Commission decides to refer SWEDEN to the Court of Justice of the European Union in order to ensure accelerated permitting procedures for renewable energy installationsToday, the European Commission decided to refer Sweden (INFR(2024)0249) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to fully transpose into national law the provisions of the revised Renewable Energy Directive related to the simplification and acceleration of permitting procedures. The amending Directive (Directive (EU) 2023/2413, amending Directive (EU) 2018/2001) entered into force in November 2023 and certain provisions had to be transposed into national law by 1 July 2024. These provisions include measures to simplify and accelerate permitting procedures both for renewable energy projects and for the infrastructure projects which are necessary to integrate the additional capacity into the electricity system. They also include clear time limits for permit-granting procedures targeted to specific technologies or types of projects, the strengthening of the role of the single contact point for applications and the presumption that renewable energy projects and the related grid infrastructure are of overriding public interest.  The Commission sent Sweden a letter of formal notice in September 2024 and a reasoned opinion in February 2025 for not having notified any transposition measures. Sweden has not yet notified any transposition measures. The Commission is therefore referring Sweden to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request to impose financial sanctions. More information is in the press release.
Commission decides to refer POLAND to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not submitting its final updated National Energy and Climate Plan  Today, the European Commission decided to refer Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to submit its final updated integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) in line with the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. Under Article 14(2) of the Governance Regulation, all Member States are obliged to submit their final updated NECPs by 30 June 2024, taking into account the Commission's recommendations and individual assessments. Poland submitted its draft plan and the Commission published the corresponding assessment in April 2024, including recommendations on where the country should raise its ambitions in line with EU targets for 2030. Following the non-submission of the final plan, the Commission contacted the Member State in a pre-infringement dialogue in July 2024. The Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Poland in November 2024. In March 2025, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion still in the absence of the final plan. Having failed to submit its final updated NECP, the Commission considers that Poland has not complied with its legal obligation and is referring it to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  More information is in the press release.
Commission decides to refer to POLAND to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to submit its national long-term climate strategyToday, the European Commission decided to refer Poland (INFR(2022)2089) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to submit its national long-term strategy in line with the Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. All EU Member States are obliged to submit their national long-term strategies defining a coherent national plan and vision for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the EU's climate neutrality objective by 2050 and its commitments under the Paris Agreement by 1 January 2020, as set out under Article 15(1) of the EU Governance Regulation. In September 2022, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Poland for failure to comply with its obligation under the EU Governance Regulation. This was followed up with a reasoned opinion in November 2023. Until now, Poland has not submitted its national long-term strategy and it is the only EU Member State that has not yet done so. The Commission considers Poland as not having complied yet with its legal obligation and is therefore referring the Member State to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in the press release.

Letters of formal notice
Commission calls on BELGIUM, FRANCE, and MALTA to fully implement the new EU VAT rules for the special SMEs scheme   The European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice to Belgium (INFR(2025)2149), France (INFR(2025)2150) and Malta (INFR(2025)2151) for not  providing all IT functionalities necessary to ensure the exchange of information between Member States, in line with the modifications introduced by Directive 2020/285/EU on the special scheme for small enterprises. The directive allows small enterprises to sell goods and services without charging VAT and alleviates their VAT compliance obligations. Moreover, small enterprises established in another Member State than where VAT is due may exempt their supplies from VAT in the same way as domestically established small enterprises can in their respective Member State. IT systems should permit the exchange of information between Member States as from 1 January 2025 in order to allow for the correct operation of the SMEs special scheme at EU level. According to the information available to the Commission, the Belgian, French and Maltese IT systems do not currently provide for all required functionalities. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Belgium, France, and Malta, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Referral to the Court of Justice
Commission decides to refer GREECE to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to remove the excise duty exemption for tax-free shops at land borders with non-EU countries Today, the European Commission decided to refer Greece (INFR(2020)2268) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to comply with Directive 2020/262/EU of 19 December 2019 laying down the general arrangements for excise duty (recast). Greece exempts from excise duty goods supplied by tax-free shops located at its land borders with Albania, North Macedonia, and Türkiye. Under Union law, Member States that had tax-free shops outside an airport or port on 1 July 2008 were allowed to use such an exemption until January 2017. Despite this no longer being allowed under EU rules, Greece continues to use this former exemption. The Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Greece to the Court of Justice of the European Union. More information is in the press release.

Commission calls on FRANCE and PORTUGAL to report on exchange of information on road traffic offencesThe European Commission decided to open two infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice to France (INFR(2025)2126) and Portugal (INFR(2025)2127) for failing to report on their cross-border exchange of information on road-safety-related traffic offences in line with Directive 2015/413/EU. The Directive allows Member States to identify and prosecute non-resident drivers committing offences, such as speeding and drink-driving on their territory. Member States must send a report to the Commission indicating the number of automated searches on offences committed on their territory by vehicles registered abroad, conducted via an online platform. The report also has to indicate the number of failed searches and include a description of the follow-up given to the offences. This information is crucial for assessing the functioning of the information exchange and the Directive's impact on road safety. Several reports should have been submitted, the latest one by 6 May 2024. However, both France and Portugal have failed to submit this required information. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to France and Portugal, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to send a reasoned opinion.
Commission calls on FRANCE and ROMANIA to correctly transpose EU rules on road infrastructure safetyThe European Commission decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice to France (INFR(2025)2133) and Romania (INFR(2025)2134), calling them to bring national legislation fully in line with EU law on infrastructure safety. Directive 2008/96/EC on road infrastructure safety management, as amended by Directive (EU) 2019/1936, lays down measures aimed at considering the safety of the vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists and powered two-wheelers) in all road safety procedures, from the initial impact assessment of new road projects to the periodic inspections of the built infrastructure. France has not completely transposed these provisions. In addition, the Directive provides for treatment of the most dangerous infrastructure sections identified during the network-wide road safety assessment, through in-depth inspections and planned remedial measures; it also requires attention to be paid to the readability and detectability of the road signs and road markings by human drivers and automated assistance systems. Romania has still to correctly transpose these provisions. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to France and Romania, which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Commission calls on BELGIUM to notify the network in scope of EU rules on road infrastructure safetyThe European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Belgium (INFR(2025)2147), calling on the authorities to notify the road network covered by EU rules on road infrastructure safety management. Directive 2008/96/EC on road infrastructure safety management, as amended by Directive (EU) 2019/1936, applies to all roads belonging to the TEN-T road network, to all motorways, to primary roads connecting major cities and regions, as well as to all interurban EU funded roads. Member States were required to notify their road network that falls within the scope of the Directive by December 2021, and Belgium has not yet done so. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Belgium, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Commission calls on SPAIN to bring national legislation fully in line with EU law on air services*
The European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Spain (INFR(2025)4019) for failing to bring national legislation fully in line with EU law on air services. Regulation (EC) 1008/2008 provides for airlines' freedom to set their prices. The CJEU in case C-487/12 stated that hand baggage should in principle be free of charge as long as it meets reasonable requirements in terms of weight and dimensions, and complies with applicable security requirements. Hand baggage which exceeds such reasonable requirements is subject to pricing freedom. Spain's national Air Navigation Law does not allow airlines to subject the carriage of any hand luggage to an additional charge, restricting airlines' freedom to set prices and to differentiate between a service that includes the right to an increased cabin baggage allowance, and a service that does not offer that possibility and merely provides the smaller allowance which constitutes a necessary aspect of carriage. Spain has also issued penalty decisions to five airlines for their policy of applying separate charges for the service of carrying supplementary cabin luggage. As these penalty decisions are based on an interpretation of C-487/12, which follows the Spanish Air Navigation Law, the penalty decisions also infringe Regulation (EC) 1008/2008. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Spain, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Referrals to the Court of Justice
Commission decides to refer ITALY to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not fully transposing EU rules on tolls and user charges for road infrastructure useToday, the European Commission decided to refer Italy (INFR(2024)0161) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to transpose EU rules on the charging of vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (Directive (EU) 2022/362, amending the ‘Eurovignette Directive'). Despite the Commission's letter of formal notice of 23 May 2024 and reasoned opinion of 16 December 2024, the Italian authorities have not notified the Commission of the amending Directive's full transposition. While Italy has so far notified two transposition measures relating to certain points of the Directive, the Commission considers that the efforts to take necessary measures by the Italian authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Italy to the Court of Justice of the European Union, requesting to impose financial sanctions. More information is in the press release.
Commission decides to refer BULGARIA and PORTUGAL to the Court of Justice of the European Union for not fully transposing EU rules on posting of drivers  Today, the European Commission decided to refer Bulgaria (INFR(2022)0196) and Portugal (INFR(2022)0251) to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to fully transpose into their national legislation the EU rules on the posting of drivers in the road transport sector. Directive (EU) 2020/1057 introduces specific rules for the posting of drivers in the road transport sector, which are essential to ensure social protection for drivers and to improve their working conditions. It also amends Directive 2006/22/EC as regards certain requirements related to the enforcement of social legislation in road transport. Late transposition of the Directive results in challenges for the drivers to receive fair remuneration, to enforce the rules correctly and for the operators to conduct their business within a clear legal framework. The deadline for the EU Member States to transpose Directive (EU) 2020/1057 into their national legislation was 2 February 2022. Bulgaria and Portugal remain only two Member States in breach of the full transposition of the Directive. The Commission considers that the efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Bulgaria and Portugal to the Court, requesting to impose financial sanctions. More information is in the press release.

Comission calls on BELGIUM, GREECE, SPAIN, NETHERLANDS, AUSTRIA, POLAND, PORTUGAL and ROMANIA to transpose amendments to the Settlement Finality Directive and the 2nd Payment Services Directive  The European Commission today decided to open infringement procedures by sending letters of formal notice to Belgium (INFR(2025)2136), Greece(INFR(2025)2139), Spain (INFR(2025)2140), Netherlands (INFR(2025)2142), Austria (INFR(2025)2135), Poland (INFR(2025)2143), Portugal (INFR(2025)2144) and Romania (INFR(2025)2145) for failing to adopt and notify the Commission of measures transposing into national law the amendments to the Settlement Finality Directive (Directive 98/26/EC) and the 2nd Payment Services Directive (Directive (EU) 2015/2366) which were introduced via the Instant Payments Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2024/886). Those amendments are intended to enable certain types of non-bank payment service providers -such as payment institutions and electronic money institutions- to become participants in payment systems designated under the Settlement Finality Directive. The amendments ensure that these non-bank payment service providers can settle payments in an efficient and competitive manner when providing services such as instant payments to their clients. The Commission is therefore sending letters of formal notice to Belgium, Greece, Spain, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal and Romania which now have two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.

Letter of formal notice, additional letter of formal notice and referral to the Court of Justice
Commission calls on ITALY to align its legislation on working conditions for honorary judges with EU lawToday, the Commission has decided to open an infringement procedure against Italy (INFR(2025)2159) by sending a letter of formal notice for failing to align its legislation on honorary judges with EU labour law. The letter of formal notice concerns honorary judges who were already in service on 15 August 2017. Since Italian law sets out different rules for judges depending on whether they were appointed before or after 15 August 2017, the Commission is pursuing two separate infringement procedures. For honororary judges recruited after that date, the Commission has decided, also today, to refer Italy to the Court of Justice of the European Union. For this category, the Commission considers that the Italian legislation still fails to comply with EU rules on fixed-term work, on part-time work, and on working time. The Commission launched this infringement procedure in July 2021 by sending a letter of formal notice to the Italian authorities, followed by an additional letter of formal notice in July 2022, a reasoned opinion in July 2023, and an additional reasoned opinion in October 2024. The Commission considers that efforts by the authorities have, to date, been insufficient and is therefore referring Italy to the Court of Justice of the European Union (INFR(2016)4081). More information is in the press release.Moreover, under Italian law, honorary judges appointed before 15 August 2017 have to give up certain rights guaranteed by EU law if they want to become permanent judges, or if they apply but are not successfully confirmed. These rights include allowances for illness, accidents and pregnancy, fiscal treatment and paid annual leave. The judges who do not get a permanent contract only receive a payment based on years of service. They also have to give up  any claims under EU law previously recognised by the Court of Justice. The Commission considers that these rules breach EU legislation on fixed-term work (Directive 1999/70/EC), part-time work (Directive 1997/81/EC), working time (Directive 2003/88/EC), and the protection of pregnant workers (Directive 89/391/EEC). Italy now has two months to reply and take the necessary measures. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.
Commission calls on AUSTRIA to comply with the enforcement directive on the posting of workersThe European Commission has decided today to issue an additional letter of formal notice to Austria (INFR(2018)2225) for failing to bring national provisions in line with the enforcement directive on the posting of workers (Directive 2014/67/EU). The directive aims to strengthen the application of the rules on posting workers, by addressing issues related to fighting fraud and circumvention of rules, access to information, and administrative cooperation between EU Member States. In particular, it sets out the administrative requirements and control measures that Member States may impose to monitor compliance. It also requires Member States to establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. The Commission opened infringement procedures in July 2021 by sending letters of formal notice to 24 Member States, including Austria. In January 2023, it followed up with reasoned opinions to 17 Member States, among them Austria. Following further analysis of the national measures, the Commission is now sending an additional letter of formal notice to Austria, which has still not correctly aligned its legislation with some provisions of the Directive. Austria has two months to take the necessary measures, otherwise the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.

Letter of formal notice
Commission calls on ROMANIA to comply with plant protection product rules to protect animal and environmental health The European Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Romania (INFR(2025)2146) for failing to comply with the Plant Protection Products Regulation (‘PPPR'), Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. Romania has repeatedly granted emergency authorisations for plant protection products containing neonicotinoid substances, contrary to the PPPR. Neonicotinoids are a group of insecticides that can be harmful to pollinators, including bees. In 2018, the Commission adopted, under the PPPR, implementing regulations which expressly prohibited outdoor use for three of them, i.e. imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Despite repeated warnings from the Commission, Romania granted, in total, 12 temporary emergency authorisations under Article 53(1) of the PPPR, in 2023 and 2024, for the outdoor use of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam for cereal seeds, maize and sunflower seeds. While emergency authorisations are a possibility for Member States under the PPPR if due  to a serious danger which cannot be contained by any other reasonable means, a preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in January 2023 clarified that emergency authorisations of thiamethoxam or imidacloprid for the treatment of seeds to be sown outdoor is excluded in the light of the explicit restrictions set out in the 2018 implementing regulations. The Commission considers that the Romanian emergency authorisations are therefore contrary to the PPPR as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The granting of emergency authorisations can be considered a persistent practice of the Romanian authorities. Furthermore, the Romanian authorities have not indicated any plans to stop granting the authorisations in question for future sowing periods. The Commission is therefore sending a letter of formal notice to Romania, which now has two months to respond and address the shortcomings raised by the Commission. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion.

AI has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. As the global race to harness its potential heats up, the European Commission has put forward two strategies that will help Europe stay ahead in AI industry and science respectively.
The Apply AI Strategy sets out how to speed up the use of AI in key industries and the public sector. It will be used to help the EU unlock its societal benefits - from more accurate healthcare diagnoses to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of public services. The strategy also addresses some of the key challenges by
To coordinate this work, the Commission is launching the Apply AI Alliance, a forum bringing together industry, the public sector, academia, social partners and civil society. Meanwhile, an AI Observatory will monitor AI trends and assess sectorial impacts.
In parallel, the Commission has launched the AI Act Service Desk to help ensure smooth implementation of the AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive AI law.
Alongside Apply AI, the AI in Science Strategy focuses on putting the EU at the forefront of AI-driven research and scientific innovation. At its centre is RAISE - the Resource for AI Science in Europe - a virtual European institute that pools and coordinates AI resources for developing AI and applying it in science.

Internet Accountability Forum spotlights global challenges to online freedoms,https://fpi.ec.europa.eu/news/internet-accountability-forum-spotlights-global-challenges-online-freedoms-2025-10-07_en,7 October 2025,"The Internet Accountability Forum gathered policymakers, civil society, researchers and private-sector actors to address how to uphold the principles of an open and rights-based internet.","The event gathered policymakers, civil society representatives, researchers and private-sector actors to address how to uphold the principles of an open and rights-based internet amid growing digital fragmentation and authoritarian control.
The Forum was held in two parts. The first day, co-organised with the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics, brought together a select group of experts to discuss disinformation, accountability in artificial intelligence, and the resilience of internet freedom ecosystems.
The second day was open to a wider audience from governments, academia, industry and civil society across regions. Through a series of panels, speakers examined how to balance accountability, security and rights in the digital sphere.
A key moment in Brussels was the launch of the Internet Accountability Compass. Developed through the EU-funded Global Initiative on the Future of the Internet, implemented by the Robert Schuman Centre at EUI, the Compass is now publicly available. It offers a practical tool to assess how countries are delivering on their digital commitments, helping strengthen transparency and trust.
States and non-state actors have endorsed principles of an open and secure internet through declarations such as the Declaration for the Future of the Internet. Yet without clear accountability mechanisms, these commitments often remain unfulfilled. The Compass aims to close this gap by tracking progress and providing a benchmark for international dialogue.
Discussions at the Forum highlighted several recurring issues:
While the Forum was not designed to produce negotiated texts, it offered forward-looking insights. Participants stressed the importance of evidence-based policymaking, sustained multi-stakeholder cooperation, and embedding human rights in digital governance frameworks. The event also underlined the need for continued international dialogue to prevent fragmentation and keep the internet global and interoperable.
For the EU, these discussions are directly relevant to external action priorities on democracy, rule of law and human rights. Initiatives such as GIFI, and tools like the Internet Accountability Compass, ensure that Europe remains engaged in shaping global debates on digital governance."

Commission proposes plan to protect EU steel industry from unfair impacts of global overcapacity,https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-proposes-plan-protect-eu-steel-industry-unfair-impacts-global-overcapacity-2025-10-07_en,7 October 2025,"The Commission has presented a proposal to protect the EU steel sector from unfair impacts of global overcapacity, a vital step towards ensuring the long-term viability of a strategically crucial industry.","The Commission has presented a proposal to protect the EU steel sector from unfair impacts of global overcapacity, a vital step towards ensuring the long-term viability of a strategically crucial industry. Delivering on the commitments set out in the EU Steel and Metal Action Plan, the proposal maintains the principle of open trade and strengthens engagement with global partners to tackle overcapacity, by:
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: ""A strong, decarbonised steel sector is vital for the European Union's competitiveness, economic security and strategic autonomy. Global overcapacity is damaging our industry. We need to act now - I urge the Council and Parliament to move ahead quickly. The Commission will continue working with industry to protect and create good jobs, and with Member States and global partners – including at WTO level - to find long-term solutions to shared challenges.”
The proposal will replace the steel safeguard measure that is set to expire by June 2026. It responds to the call from EU workers, industry, several Member States, Members of the European Parliament, and stakeholders to offer strong and permanent protection to the EU steel industry, with a view to safeguarding EU jobs, and supporting the sector in its decarbonisation efforts.
Steel overcapacity is a global problem that requires strong, genuine and joint action by all partners. The Commission will continue leading international work on finding collective solutions to effectively tackle the root causes of global overcapacity, including in the framework of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity. With its proposed measure, the Commission invites like-minded countries to work together with a view to ring-fencing their economies from global overcapacity while securing supply chains and increasing mutual market access.
The proposed measure is fully WTO compliant. Upon receipt of a mandate from the Council, the Commission will swiftly engage with affected EU trading partners under the Article XXVIII GATT procedure regarding this change to the EU's WTO tariffs, with a view to offering them country specific allocations.
In view of the close and unique integration into the EU's internal market under the EEA Agreement, exports from Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein will not be subject to tariff quotas or duties. Separately, interests of a candidate country facing an exceptional and immediate security situation, such as Ukraine, should also be reflected upon when deciding on the quota allocations, without undermining the effectiveness of the measure.
Next steps
The Commission's proposal will now be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, thus it will be for the European Parliament and the Council to agree on the final regulation.
The Council Decision authorising the opening of negotiations will need a qualified majority in the Council to be adopted.
Once adopted by the Council and Parliament, the measure will replace the EU's safeguard on steel, when it expires in June 2026. By tabling today, the Commission is wants to ensure uninterrupted protection of the EU steel sector.
Background
Steel is an essential material for the EU economy, including for its green transition, due to its use in a plethora of strategically important sectors including defence. The EU steelmaking industry is the world's third largest steel producer. It employs around 300,000 people directly and supports some 2.5 million jobs indirectly, with steel production sites across more than 20 EU Member States. Steel plants sustain many regional economies, underlining their socio-economic and political importance.
The EU steel industry is currently facing significant pressure from unsustainable levels of global overcapacity, which is more than five times the EU's annual steel consumption (currently 620 million tonnes and projected to grow to 721 million tonnes by 2027). This increasing overcapacity, increasing imports of steel and closing of third country markets add to the internal challenges faced by the EU steel industry. These include an increase of trade-restrictive measures across third countries, high energy and manufacturing costs in the EU, and lower internal demand. These challenges unduly weaken the EU industry's competitiveness in a global market, undermining the industry's ability to invest notably in decarbonisation and threatening its long-term viability.
The EU steel industry is the only major region that has lost some 65 million tonnes of capacity since 2007. In 2024, the capacity utilisation rate reached 67% [healthy rates are around 80%] and some 9,000-100,000 jobs have been lost since 2007. The sector recorded record losses in 2024.
In light of these critical challenges, the Commission announced its intention to prepare a new steel measure in its Steel and Metals Action Plan (SMAP) of March 2025, with President von der Leyen reiterating the EU's commitment to protecting its steel industry in her State of the European Union (SOTEU) address.
The proposed measure is based on an economic analysis, including an assessment of the potential impacts of various options, as well as insights gathered through a targeted consultation of sectoral stakeholders which took place over the summer. Many of the over 500 respondents, both across the industry (producers and users) and across  EU Member States, were strongly supportive of a measure which significantly reduces the volume of tariff quotas on steel applicable against all origins, with a high out-of-quota duty level which they see as necessary to preserve a strong and sustainable steel industry in the EU. The economic analysis and a summary of the results of the stakeholder consultation are presented in a Staff Working Document accompanying the proposal.

Questions and Answers
A strong, decarbonised steel sector is vital for the European Union’s competitiveness, economic security and strategic autonomy. Global overcapacity is damaging our industry. We need to act now - I urge the Council and Parliament to move ahead quickly. The Commission will continue working with industry to protect and create good jobs, and with Member States and global partners – including at WTO level - to find long-term solutions to shared challenges.
An industrial future for Europe is impossible without a vibrant and resilient steel industry. By protecting our market from unfair global competition, we are building a path for a sovereign decarbonized European steel. This proposal is the first step for our industry to regain competitiveness. We now have to focus our efforts on the other parts of the action plan: CBAM reform, Clean industrial deal and demand measures. That is why I call on the co-legislators for an urgent and swift adoption of the proposal so our industry can invest, grow, and innovate.
EU trade is about fair, rules-based competition, and this measure will help our steel industry compete fairly amid increasing global overcapacity. I look forward to opening consultations and negotiations with the EU’s key trading partners in this sector through the WTO rules-based process. Ultimately, the EU remains committed to working with all willing partners towards a collective response to the challenge of global overcapacity. I will be further discussing this later in the week with key trading partners at the Ministerial meeting of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity on 10 October.

How to interview while employed,https://eures.europa.eu/how-interview-while-employed-2025-10-07_en,7 October 2025,"Exploring your career options doesn’t need to be only for occasions when you are unemployed. However, there are some special considerations for interviewing while already holding a job.","You might be happily employed or looking for a way out of your current work situation. In any of these scenarios, you are entitled – and sometimes encouraged – to check out what is out there. Perhaps it’s out of curiosity. You have been with the same company or in the same role for a long time, and you have lost touch with current market trends. Or you might be driven by a more pressing need for change, because you feel stagnant, burned out, or unmotivated in your current role.
In any case, interviewing with another company while you are already employed is nothing to feel guilty about. However, you do need to adhere to some ‘rules’ that will help you make the right choices, protect your current work situation, and also elevate you in the eyes of potential employers.
Be selective
If you are already in employment, you have a significant advantage: choice. When you are not anxious about making a living, you can be more selective about the opportunities you explore further. Take the time to focus on the companies and roles you feel would be the best fit for you and know that you don’t have to attend every interview you are invited to if you decide that the opportunity doesn’t align with your greater vision and goals.
Be upfront about your current employment status
There is no need to hide the fact that you are employed; it is well within your rights to explore another opportunity, provided you go about it the right way. However, you do need to be prepared for the inevitable question: Why do you want to leave your current role? Here, you need to balance honesty with tactfulness, which brings us to the next point.
Never discredit your current employer or job
You might be miserable in your current role for various reasons: the organisation fails to support your needs; there are serious communication issues between you and your manager and/or colleagues; you feel unchallenged, bored, or overwhelmed. No matter the situation, do not treat your interviewer as your confidante, hoping they will sympathise. When asked about the reasons you are actively looking for another job, you can mention the good things you have taken away from your current role, expressing your desire to explore your potential further. That way, you are letting a prospective employer know that if down the line you decide to pursue another opportunity, you will grant them the same courtesy.
Keep your job search private
Do not share your job search activities in your current work environment, even with colleagues you consider friends. If your pursuits leak out in any way, even unintentionally, you might be put in an awkward position with your manager or boss. When sending out your resume, do it via private channels.
Remain present
It is important not to let your job search interfere with your current work. Schedule interviews for outside your working hours and save your search and application activities for evenings or weekends. While you are still officially with an employer, keep up the quality of your work and continue to carry out your duties to the same standard.
Exit respectfully
Finally, if you do decide to switch roles, give your current employer sufficient notice, and make sure you part in the best of terms.

The Balkan Medical Force receives fully equipped field hospital through the European Peace Facility,https://fpi.ec.europa.eu/news/balkan-medical-force-receives-fully-equipped-field-hospital-through-european-peace-facility-2025-10-07_en,7 October 2025,The European Union has delivered a field hospital to the Balkan Medical Task Force (BMTF) in North Macedonia.,"Deliveries to the Balkan Medical Task Force are continuing this week with the handover of a fully equipped Role 2 field hospital in North Macedonia. A Role 2 hospital is a second-level military medical unit that provides a higher degree of medical care than a forward (Role 1) facility but is still close to combat or field operations.
The hospital comprises 20 tents provided with beds, heaters, air conditioners, and generators. Unpacking, training of the end users and handover were completed this week in the presence of the supplier, the EU Delegation to North Macedonia, and ITF Enhancing Human Security, the organisation currently implementing the support. This delivery follows previous batches of supplies including medical and laboratory items, IT and communication equipment and engineering vehicles.
The support is funded by the European Peace Facility under an assistance measure adopted in 2022 and worth EUR 6 million. The assistance is benefitting the Balkan Medical Task Force and its eligible participating nations, namely the medical units of the Armed Forces of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro. The aim of the assistance measure is to contribute to disaster relief operations in the region and a better protection of civilians. Cooperation with the Western Balkans under the EPF currently comprises 9 assistance measures for a total value of EUR 98 million."
Adapting VET to meet the needs of the labour market in Belgium-fr,https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/adapting-vet-meet-needs-labour-market-belgium-fr-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,The peer review gathered Belgian-fr public authorities in charge of VET and EQAVET international peer reviewers to discuss the links between labour market and societal needs in the governance of VET as well as between training outcomes and labour market needs.,"The peer review gathered Belgian-fr public authorities in charge of VET and EQAVET international peer reviewers to discuss the links between labour market and societal needs in the governance of VET as well as between training outcomes and labour market needs.
The French-speaking Belgium EQAVET NRP hosted their peer review on 25-26 September in Namur (Belgium) in partnership with the organisations with responsibility for VET in Wallonia and Brussels. The peer review focused on adapting VET to meet the needs of the labour market. Eight EQAVET Network members from Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Romania and Slovenia acted as peer reviewers.
French-speaking public authorities in Belgium collect, analyse and use labour market data to support the development of a wide range of VET programmes for young people and adults. These public authorities guide the provision of VET in a system where individual training providers/networks are autonomous and use learning outcomes and certification processes which are determined centrally. The peer review aimed at supporting the host in improving the use of data to enhance decision making, identifying data collection and analysis good practices, evaluating and refining indicators to better reflect labour market demands and optimising existing tools.
The peer review was the opportunity to reflect on the challenges associated with understanding labour market needs for VET, the strengthening of the collaboration between public authorities, the benefits of using targets to support data collection and usage, enhancing transparency through greater sharing of information and data, ways to encourage VET providers to make greater use of labour market data, how to quality assure labour market data, as well as the benefits of analysing drop-out rates.
Read the flash report summarising the main outcomes of the discussion.
Additionally, a separate report containing detailed feedback from the peer reviewers will be shared with the host country."
Calculating the global warming potential of new buildings: Open for public feedback,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/calculating-global-warming-potential-new-buildings-open-public-feedback-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,The Commission has opened the feedback period on  draft rules relating to the calculation of the life-cycle global warming potential (GWP) of new buildings.,"The Commission has opened the feedback period on draft rules relating to the calculation of the life-cycle global warming potential (GWP) of new buildings.
The life-cycle GWP of a building brings together greenhouse gas emissions embodied in construction products with direct and indirect greenhouse emissions from the use stage. Under Article 7 of the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the Commission is required to establish an EU framework for the national calculation of the life-cycle GWP of new buildings. It must be disclosed in the energy performance certificate for large new buildings (with a floor space of over 1000m2) from January 2028 and for all new buildings from January 2030. The draft delegated regulation sets out a harmonised, simplified way of carrying out this calculation.
The mandatory calculation of GWP based on the calculation framework in the delegated regulation creates an incentive to use low-carbon construction materials including clean steel and cement, thereby fostering lead markets for such products, and biobased material such as wood which promotes the carbon storage in buildings. The Commission believes that this harmonisation and simplification to the rules can foster transparency and and boost European competitiveness and industrial innovation.
This draft delegated act builds on a series of consultations and workshops since the start of this year. Following this 4 week feedback period (which closes on 31 October) and an opinion from the relevant expert group (likely before the end of October), the aim is that the delegated regulation can be formally adopted in December. Under EU rules, the Council and the European Parliament will then have a 2-month period to object (which can be prolonged by a further 2 months if requested).
Feedback will be published on the Commission website in line with its feedback rules."
Seven-year Earth observation partnership concludes with event in Brussels,https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/seven-year-earth-observation-partnership-concludes-event-brussels-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,"On 1 October 2025, DG DEFIS and German Aerospace Centre DLR co-hosted an event in Brussels to mark the coming to an end of a seven-year partnership.

Participants from across Europe shared their experiences of some of the more than 220 actions undertaken in support of the uptake of data and services from Copernicus, the flagship Earth observation component of the European Union’s Space Programme.
Started in 2018, the Caroline Herschel Framework Partnership Agreement (also known as the Framework Partnership Agreement for Copernicus User Uptake, or FPCUP)—named so after the famous astronomer active in the 18th and 19th centuries—was a bottom-up initiative involving 50 partners from 23 European countries with co-funding from the European Commission to enhance national user uptake of Copernicus. This objective was realised through the promotion of opportunities provided by Copernicus data and services, the building of active networks and communities, and the development and implementation of new services and applications based on its Earth observation data.
Under the overall management of DG DEFIS and the coordination of DLR, actions were initiated by partners based on their experience and knowledge of end-user priorities and preferences, covering a range of different areas, from environmental monitoring and water management to disaster response and educational programmes.
In his closing remarks, Mr Mauro Facchini, Head of the Copernicus Unit at DG DEFIS, highlighted the many achievements and positive spin-off effects of the partnership, including the creation of strong networks and communities of practice across Europe. He also noted, as seen from space through Copernicus data, the Union appears without internal borders—visually mirroring the cross-border nature of this collaboration.
Mr Jens Danzeglocke, Earth Observation Focal Point with DLR, in his closing remarks emphasized the importance of continuing to put Copernicus data and services to the full use and benefit of all Europeans.
To help capture and catalogue the lessons learned from the past seven years, DLR—with input from DG DEFIS and critical contributions from participating partners with hands-on experience from Copernicus user uptake—has developed a publication dedicated to FPCUP, which was provided to those attending the event. This publication (Framework Partnership Agreement for Copernicus User Uptake: Highlights and Achievements) will be made available on the forthcoming EU Space Programme website. This new website will also feature content from FPCUP’s site, which will be closed at the end of 2025.
The recording of the webcast of the concluding FPCUP event is available here."
EU and São Tomé and Príncipe renew sustainable fisheries partnership,https://oceans-and-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-and-sao-tome-and-principe-renew-sustainable-fisheries-partnership-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,The European Union and São Tomé and Príncipe have signed a new protocol to continue their 40-year-old partnership on fisheries.,"The European Union and São Tomé and Príncipe have signed a new protocol to continue their 40-year-old partnership on fisheries.
The new four-year protocol will allow EU vessels to fish around 6,500 tonnes of tuna and other migratory species per year in São Tomé and Príncipe’s waters. At the same time, increased EU financial support will foster the sustainable development of the fisheries sector in São Tomé and Príncipe.
The EU contribution over 4 years will amount to €3.3 million, i.e. €825,000 per year. €500,000 will be dedicated every year specifically to support São Tomé and Príncipe’s sustainable fisheries management, control and surveillance capacities, artisanal fishing and local fishing communities.
In addition to EU funding, EU shipowners will pay São Tomé and Príncipe a licensing and catch fee of €85 per tonne of fish caught to operate in the country’s waters.
The provisions of the new protocol will reinforce the good ocean governance and job creation and ensure better working conditions for fishers employed on EU vessels.
Both sides agreed to work together on sustainability of the fish stocks by increasing scientific knowledge and boosting capacity of local administrations to manage fisheries resources.
The protocol explicitly mentions the obligation to respect the recommendations and resolutions of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and other agreements and legal instruments applicable to sustainable fisheries. It also includes a commitment to respect the working conditions established by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), as well as by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
The new protocol will apply provisionally as of 6 October 2025 and will enter into force as soon as the ratification process by both parties has been completed. On the EU side, this implies the consent of the European Parliament.
The EU sustainable fisheries partnership with São Tomé and Príncipe is part of the network of tuna fisheries agreements with various countries of the region. It is part of EU efforts to increase food security and promote adequate supply for consumers.
The first agreement entered into force in 1985. The current fisheries partnership agreement concluded between the EU and São Tomé and Príncipe in 2007 is tacitly renewed every four years. To be operational, it requires an implementing protocol, setting conditions for EU fishing activities and contributions to the sustainable development of São Tomé and Príncipe fisheries sector. The new protocol will replace the previous one, which expired in December 2024.
Sustainable fisheries partnership agreements (SFPAs)
Commissioner for Fisheries and Oceans Costas Kadis said:
“Today marks a significant milestone as we have a new implementing protocol to our Fishery Partnership Agreement with São Tomé and Príncipe. This protocol reinforces our shared commitment to responsible, sustainable fisheries and shows the power of cooperation in preserving the ocean. Together we secure the future of our shared resources, supporting local communities and ecosystems. Our collaboration sets a model for sustainable fishing that benefits all and fosters long-term ecological and economic resilience.”"
De-prioritisation of Level 2 acts in financial services legislation,https://finance.ec.europa.eu/news/de-prioritisation-level-2-acts-financial-services-legislation-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,"The Commission, in line with its broader simplification agenda, has informed the European Supervisory Authorities and the Anti‑Money laundering Authority (AMLA) of its plan to deprioritise 115 non‑essential level 2 acts.","The EU has a comprehensive legal framework, in which many of the rules are regulatory and implementing standards (Level 2) that supplement or specify the EU Regulations and Directives (Level 1). In the last legislature, level 1 acts empowered the Commission to adopt around 430 level 2 measures.
A high volume of level 2 acts can lead to compliance costs and regulatory complexity for stakeholders, while demanding significant resources from co‑legislators to scrutinise them. In consultation with the EU co‑legislators, the Commission informed the three European Supervisory Authorities and the Anti‑Money laundering Authority (AMLA) that it will not adopt these non‑essential acts before 1 October 2027. Where empowerments have legal deadlines, the Commission will propose to amend or repeal them during the upcoming revisions of the relevant Level 1 acts.
The Commission’s de‑prioritisation of some level 2 measures is a pragmatic approach that can deliver simplification quickly, in line with the savings and investments union objectives and the Commission’s simplification agenda."
Countdown to launch – Copernicus Sentinel-1D lifts off in November,https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/countdown-launch-copernicus-sentinel-1d-lifts-november-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,"On 4 November 2025, Sentinel-1D will lift off from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, ensuring the continuity of services on which a wide range of end users rely worldwide.","On 4 November 2025, Sentinel-1D will lift off from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, ensuring the continuity of services on which a wide range of end users rely worldwide.
The Sentinel-1 mission uses radar to create high-resolution, day-and-night, all-weather images of Earth's surface for land and ocean monitoring, including tracking sea ice and oil spills, mapping land use changes, assessing soil moisture, monitoring land surface deformation, and aiding in emergency response to disasters like floods and earthquakes.
Data from Sentinel-1 satellites flows directly into Copernicus Services. It underpins the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) for flood mapping, the Copernicus Maritime Surveillance (CMS) Service for oil spill and vessel detection, and the Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) for monitoring icebergs and sea ice concentration to support safe navigation. It also supports the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) for vegetation, forest and agricultural monitoring. Notably, Sentinel-1 radar data processed with interferometry is used in the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), part of CLMS, to detect and track ground motion from subsidence, landslides, volcanic activity and earthquakes.
Sentinel-1D joins Sentinel-1C, launched in December 2024. Both satellites are equipped with Galileo-enabled receivers for more accurate in-orbit positioning and carry an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload which detects signals from ships, supporting maritime domain awareness and the detection of unauthorised activities at sea. Sentinel-1D’s launch aboard Ariane 6 reflects Europe’s growing capacity to put its satellites into orbit on its own terms, strengthening the resilience of Copernicus Services and the EU’s strategic autonomy.

Commission launches public consultation on CO2 markets and infrastructure,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-launches-public-consultation-co2-markets-and-infrastructure-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,The feedback received will inform the Commission’s initiative planned for 2026.,"The European Commission has identified the need to considerably scale-up and invest in clean energy infrastructure and technologies, such as CO2 infrastructure and storage, as we work to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. For this reason, the Commission has today launched an open public consultation on upcoming legislation and impact assessment on CO2 markets and infrastructure in the EU. The consultation is open until 9 January 2026. The feedback received will inform the Commission’s initiative planned for 2026.
Amongst other things, the consultation builds on the Communication on the 2040 Climate Target and its impact assessment, which recognise the role of carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) in reducing harmful emissions from hard-to-abate sectors. Furthermore, the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy (COM/2024/62) recognises the need for a legislative initiative with a view to develop competitive markets and transportation infrastructure for CO2.
The EU is committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5 °C with ambitious and pragmatic intermediary targets. Achieving these targets and weaning off the EU’s reliance on fossil fuels requires decisive climate action across all sectors of the economy.
The Industrial carbon management strategy, through CCUS, has an important role to play in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial carbon management is a sound and important building block for a sustainable and competitive economy in Europe. The EU has the opportunity to create an economic edge in industrial carbon management technologies, opening up global business opportunities."
Commission approves Austrian scheme to support security of electricity supply,https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/about/news/commission-approves-austrian-scheme-support-security-electricity-supply-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,"The scheme will support security of electricity supply for a period of 5 years starting in October 2026.
It is an extension and update of the existing network reserve that was approved in 2021 and will end
in 2026.","The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, an Austrian scheme to safeguard security of electricity supply.
The scheme will support security of electricity supply for a period of 5 years starting in October 2026. It is an extension and update of the existing network reserve that was approved in 2021 and will end in 2026. Among various technical changes, the new scheme includes monthly contracts and other updates designed to increase participation of smaller resources, in particular electricity consumers that can provide demand response by reducing energy use.
The scheme will support electricity capacity that remains in reserve outside the market and is ready to be activated by the system operators whenever there is insufficient transmission capacity to match generation and demand (‘transmission congestion').
Where there is transmission congestion, system operators turn off capacity in oversupplied parts of the bidding zone, and turn on capacity in parts of the bidding zone where there is a deficit.
Under the scheme, one of the Austrian transmission system operators, Austrian Power Grid AG (APG), will pay operators of power plants that have notified their intention to close down their plants, but which are relevant to keep the electricity system in balance, for remaining available to the network. The scheme will also be open to electricity storage facilities and demand-response providers. The subsidised capacity must remain available and be located in parts of Austria or neighbouring countries where it can help manage transmission congestion. The aid will take the form of direct grants paid per megawatt of available capacity held in the reserve, as well as payments to cover operating costs when capacity is activated. The costs of the scheme will be recovered from consumers in locations where there is a capacity shortfall, via network charges on consumer bills.
The aid will be granted via a competitive bidding process, unless the Austrian energy regulator identifies that such a bidding process would be insufficiently competitive, in which case the aid would be allocated based on each beneficiary's specific costs.
The Commission's assessment
The Commission assessed the scheme under EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU'), which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and the Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy (‘CEEAG').
The Commission found that:
On this basis, the Commission approved the Austrian scheme under EU State aid rules.
Background
The Commission's 2022 CEEAG provide guidance on how the Commission assesses the compatibility of environmental protection, including climate protection, and energy aid measures which are subject to the notification requirement under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU.
The Guidelines create a flexible, fit-for-purpose enabling framework to help Member States provide the necessary support to reach the European Green Deal objectives in a targeted and cost-effective manner. The rules involve an alignment with the important EU's goals and targets set out in the European Green Deal and with other recent regulatory changes in the energy and environmental areas and cater for the increased importance of climate protection. They include sections on energy efficiency measures, aid for clean mobility, infrastructure, circular economy, pollution reduction, protection and restoration of biodiversity, as well as measures to ensure security of energy supply, subject to certain conditions.
Electricity transmission congestion occurs when generation in one location cannot be transported to another location where there is demand. Electricity transmission lines in Europe are increasingly congested due to a combination of the maintenance of large bidding zones (geographic areas in which a single electricity price is formed, assuming no transmission constraints) and increasing shares of variable renewable electricity generation which require additional transmission to be transported.
Demand response is a change in the power consumption of an electricity consumer. A reduction in electricity consumption can have the same effect as an increase in electricity generation, in terms of achieving a balance between electricity supply and demand, so demand response can play an important role in measures for security of electricity supply.
The European electricity market is arranged in bidding zones, which are geographical areas in which electricity trading takes place, ignoring transmission limits. Austria comprises a single bidding zone. Once the market has cleared, system operators need to ensure that the result of the market can be put into operation. If there is transmission congestion, the system operators generally need to turn off capacity in oversupplied parts of the bidding zone and turn on capacity in other parts of the bidding zone. The EU Electricity Regulation establishes rules to ensure the functioning of the internal market for electricity and includes a bidding zone review process that may in future lead to a reduced need for active congestion management and measures like the network reserve.
For More Information
The non-confidential version of today's decision will be made available under the case number SA.113090 in the State aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the Competition Weekly e-News.
The measure approved today will help to ensure the security of Austria’s electricity supply. This also supports the security of the wider European electricity grid. The measure will be open to all types of capacity in a competitive process, which will help keep costs down.

Summary report: Reality check on tax exemptions for ethyl alcohol,https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/news/summary-report-reality-check-tax-exemptions-ethyl-alcohol-2025-10-06_en,6 October 2025,A reality check on tax exemptions for ethyl alcohol took place on 25 September. Read the summary report.,"The event attracted great interest from businesses across the EU. After an introduction by Ms Maria Elena SCOPPIO (Director, Indirect Taxation and Tax Administration), participants had the opportunity to exchange directly with the Commission at technical level.
The constructive and meaningful discussion with the businesses showed that while the EU regulatory framework works coherently in general, businesses still sometimes encounter difficulties in cross-border trade, including when moving flavours and other exempt products, sharing samples with prospective customers and using alcohol in the production of pharmaceutical active raw materials.
The discussion showed that there is potential for more harmonisation, like in case of sending samples cross border or setting common thresholds for transport losses. Businesses also calledfor clarifying or specifying the current EU harmonised rules, because they seem to be sometimes interpreted differently at national levels.
The Commission welcomed the valuable feedback received, which will feed into the reflections on potential simplifications of the excise rules.

Months of raids on independent media, the passing of laws targeting civil society, the jailing of opponents and activists or amendments to the electoral code favouring the ruling party,  drastically reduced the possibility of having competitive elections. A large part of the opposition boycotted these elections, and the turnout was relatively low.
In addition, the refusal by the Georgian authorities to invite international monitors in due time, in particular OSCE/ODIHR, undermined the transparency of the electoral process and prevented credible international monitoring. Domestic organisations also refrained from observing due to the repressive environment.
Large numbers of people constantly protested the repressive policies of the governing party, Georgian Dream. We call for the release of all those arbitrarily detained.
We urge calm and restraint in the post-election period and call on the authorities to uphold citizens’ rights to freedom of assembly and expression. A constructive and inclusive dialogue involving all political actors and civil society is essential, and we call on every side to refrain from violence.
Finally, the European Union firmly rejects and condemns the disinformation regarding the EU’s role in Georgia and denounces the personal attacks against the Ambassador of the European Union to Georgia."

Moreover, integrating circularity measures in these industries would improve the EU’s energy and economic security by reducing import dependency.
A new JRC report shows how circular economy practices would contribute to substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions in sectors such as plastics, steel, aluminium, cement and concrete. Improved materials management, including reduction, reuse and recovery measures, could help EU industry reduce between 189 and 231 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per year. Circularity measures could be particularly effective in reducing emissions in the steel sector (by 64 to 81 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per year) and the plastics sector (75 to 84 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per year).
Steel  64-81 Mt CO2-eq.
Aluminium  12-14 Mt CO2-eq.
Cement & concrete 38-52 Mt CO2-eq.
Plastics  75-84 Mt CO2-eq.

Circularity measures in these four sectors would also lower EU-wide fossil fuel energy demand by nearly 4.7% compared to 2023.  The EU-wide consumption of electricity would fall by a similar rate. All in all, this could reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels and critical materials necessary for electricity generation, while enhancing the EU’s resilience amid global energy volatility.
Beyond environmental benefits, circular economy strategies would improve the EU’s trade balance by about 4%, corresponding to 35 billion euro. This gain stems from reduced imports of raw materials such as iron ore (decreasing by 22%) and bauxite (lowered by 11%), as well as fossil fuels, with plastics contributing the largest share of the surplus.
The report includes recommendations to help policymakers and industry make informed decisions about circular economy measures that can support the EU's transition to a more sustainable and competitive economy.
Policy recommendations include promoting technologies to improve the quality of recycled materials, reducing the use of resources through more efficient design, and steering market demand via Green Public Procurement instruments.
These strategies align with EU goals to enhance sustainability and competitiveness, whilst mitigating macroeconomic risks from global dependencies.
The JRC report Capturing the Potential of the Circular Economy Transition in Energy-Intensive Industrieslooks at the potential of circular economy levers to decrease the environmental impact of the steel, aluminium, cement and concrete, and plastics industries by 2050, while improving energy and economic security. The impacts of the circular economy are quantified relative to an alternative scenario without circular economy strategies. In this alternative scenario in the year 2050, the policy mix to reach climate neutrality does not resort to circular economy measures and the industries investigated still show hard-to-abate greenhouse gas emissions. These findings are further developed in four JRC reports focused on the individual industries.
The EU Competitiveness compass, published in January 2025, and the Clean Industrial Deal, published in February 2025, emphasise the importance of circular economy in creating a more sustainable, resilient and competitive European industrial sector, that in turn supports the EU's climate goals, while promoting more efficient technologies and job creation.

EU welcomes UN aviation agency’s condemnation of Russia for undermining global aviation safety,https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/eu-welcomes-un-aviation-agencys-condemnation-russia-undermining-global-aviation-safety-2025-10-03_en,3 October 2025,The ICAO has formally condemned Russia for repeatedly interfering with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals in Europe.,"The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), during its 42nd Assembly, has today formally condemned Russia for repeatedly interfering with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals in Europe. The Assembly reaffirmed that harmful GNSS interference, including jamming and spoofing, undermines the foundations of global aviation safety and violates the Chicago Convention, the founding treaty of ICAO.
Based on evidence presented by six EU Member States – Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden – the Assembly recognised that the source of harmful GNSS interference affecting air operations in the Baltic, Eastern, and Northern European regions originates from Russia.
Despite ICAO’s calls urging Russia to cease these activities, no corrective actions or engagement have occurred. The Assembly urgently called for Russia to halt this interference and fulfill its international obligations. Additionally, it requested that all ICAO States be promptly informed of Russia's condemnation and its violation of the Chicago Convention.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, said: ""The interference with GNSS services is completely unacceptable, and I welcome the unequivocal condemnation from ICAO Member States of these serious violations. Such disruptive activities pose a direct threat to aviation safety and security. It is imperative that those responsible are held fully accountable for their actions."""
Commission consults on revised State aid rules for better access to affordable housing,https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/about/news/commission-consults-revised-state-aid-rules-better-access-affordable-housing-2025-10-03_en,3 October 2025,"The European Commission has today launched a public consultation on the revision of the State aid
rules to help Member States with affordable housing. This revision of the services of general economic
interest (‘SGEI') rules will address challenges related to housing affordability.","The European Commission has today launched a public consultation on the revision of the State aid rules to help Member States with affordable housing. This revision of the services of general economic interest (‘SGEI') rules will address challenges related to housing affordability that go beyond social housing. The goal is to allow EU countries to support affordable housing in a faster and simpler way, by revising SGEI Decision 2012/21/EU. This will contribute to the Commission's efforts to address European citizens' housing needs, which will also include a proposal for a European affordable housing plan.
Any interested citizen, business, public authority or association can contribute to the public consultation until 4 November 2025 via the COMP Website.
Revision process of SGEI Decision
As set out in the Commission's Political Guidelines, the current State aid rules are not adapted to allow Member States to effectively tackle the various challenges related to housing affordability that go beyond social housing.
This revision will offer Member States a new tool to address the urgency of the housing crisis, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity by allowing them to adapt these rules to their specific contextual needs.
For this, a new category of exemption is added to the SGEI Decision for affordable housing, which allows State aid to be granted without notification to the Commission. The new definition in the SGEI Decision is as follows: ""Housing for households, who are not able, due to market outcomes and notably market failures, to access housing at affordable conditions”. The Decision includes specific conditions for affordable housing services of general economic interest.
The new SGEI Decision also proposes introducing sectorial changes concerning critical medicines, and the aviation and maritime sectors. The revision also includes changes to update and simplify the rules.
Public consultation and next steps
The draft SGEI Decision results from a public consultation and a Call for evidence held in June and July 2025. The Commission received over 120 replies to the Call for evidence and more than 140 for the public consultation.
This proposal also benefitted from a ‘reality check' meeting, where stakeholders and Member States gave input on real-life situations and the main obstacles to implementing State aid rules in the housing sector.
The current consultation will help the Commission to assess, in a collaborative, transparent and inclusive manner, how the SGEI Decision needs to be amended to facilitate affordable housing investments.
The feedback received from this consultation and of broader stakeholder engagement will feed into the ongoing review of the SGEI decision. The Commission will adopt the revised SGEI Decision before the end of the year.
General background
The issue of access to housing affordability is not confined to lower income groups. It now also affects a wider section of society due to various factors, including rising demand in urban areas, increased housing costs, a shortage in housing supply, an aging building stock, regional economic disparities, and tourism and short-term rentals.
In response to this acute pressing housing crisis, the Commission plans to introduce a European Affordable Housing Plan by the end of 2025, aimed at complementing housing policies at national, regional, and local levels while maintaining the principle of subsidiarity.
Among the key initiatives envisaged, the Commission is revising the State aid rules to facilitate financing for affordable housing solutions.
For more information
More information on the Commission's work on affordable housing is available on the dedicated website.
One of the major social challenges in Europe is the difficulty of accessing affordable housing. Tackling this issue requires joint efforts with different authorities contributing through a wide range of measures. From a competition perspective, we are responding to the requests from national authorities by submitting a concrete proposal for a review of the SGEI rules to facilitate the funding of affordable housing for public consultation today.

Commission restricts use of ‘forever chemicals' in firefighting foams,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-restricts-use-pfas-firefighting-foams-2025-10-03_en,3 October 2025,The measures will protect people and the environment from the risks posed by 'forever chemicals'.,"Today, the Commission adopted new measures restricting the use of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in firefighting foams under the REACH Regulation, the EU's chemicals legislation. This is an important measure that protects people and the environment from the risks posed by PFAS.
The restriction marks a major step towards the Commission's objective to minimise PFAS emissions. Firefighting foams have been a major source of pollution in the EU. Without this restriction, around 470 tonnes of this kind of chemicals would continue to be emitted into the environment every year, contaminating soil and water. Additionally, firefighters would also continue to be exposed to PFAS present in the foams used.
PFAS-free firefighting foams are available and affected operators need sufficient time to smoothly transition to PFAS-free alternatives. The Commission has therefore proposed specific transition periods for different sectors.
This restriction is based on the scientific assessment of the European Chemicals Agency's Committees and has successfully passed the scrutiny of the European Parliament and the Council.
Next steps
This restriction will formally enter into force 20 days after publication in the Official Journal. It will take effect after transition periods of between 12 months and 10 years, depending on the use, allowing time for replacement by safer and effective alternatives.
Background
PFAS are called ‘forever chemicals' because they do not break down in the natural environment. They require special attention, considering the large number of cases of contamination of soil and water, including drinking water. In the past 20 years, the EU has taken increasing action to control the risks from exposure to PFAS. Today's restriction covers this kind of chemicals present in firefighting foams, ensuring a full transition to PFAS-free firefighting foams in the EU. The restriction proposal will aim to limit pollution and people's exposure to this type of chemicals.
For more information
Restriction on PFAS in firefighting foams
ECHA web page on PFAS
With today’s step to restrict the use of PFAS in firefighting foams, we are protecting both people and the environment from these forever chemicals, while ensuring fire safety is not compromised. This is an important milestone on our path to a toxic-free environment and a more sustainable future for Europe.
Today’s ban on all PFAS in firefighting foams is good news for the environment and public health. Around 60% of firefighting foams contain PFAS. This has led to many cases of contamination of soil and water, including drinking water. This is an important step forward to tackle PFAS pollution across Europe.

Commission's assessment of Estonia and Slovakia National Energy and Climate Plans shows improvements on ambition closing in  on 2030 targets but more efforts needed,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/commissions-assessment-estonia-and-slovakia-national-energy-and-climate-plans-shows-improvements-2025-10-02_en,2 October 2025,The Commission assessment of the 2 NECPs includes guidance to facilitate implementation.,"The Commission has published its assessment of the final updated National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) of Estonia and Slovakia (SWD/2025/282). The assessment finds that, while Estonia and Slovakia have raised their ambition compared to the draft plans, efforts are needed to implement the plans and close any remaining gaps on renewable energy, energy efficiency, as well as towards the national targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation (EU/2018/842) and to increase carbon removals under the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation (EU/2018/841). The Commission assessment of the 2 NECPs includes guidance to facilitate implementation.
This publication complements the EU-wide assessment (COM/2025/274) published on 28 May 2025, which described significant progress by EU countries towards closing in on the EU’s 2030 climate and energy targets.
The Commission assessment found that further efforts are needed to reach Estonia’s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Effort Sharing Sectors (transport, buildings, agriculture, waste) by 24% by 2030 compared to 2005. Estonia also projects to have a gap towards reaching its target of increasing removals in the LULUCF sector.
Estonia has an ambitious strategy on renewable energy, aiming for 100% of electricity generation from renewables by 2030 with support measures to increase wind power through auctions and measures for effective production of renewable heat. However, on energy efficiency, Estonia needs to better quantify projected energy savings and strengthen the legislative framework to better integrate electricity, heating, and cooling networks into the energy system.
Estonia is strengthening its energy security by diversifying gas supplies to alternatives like biomethane and biogas and building storage capacity and improving the resilience of its electricity system by improving connections with neighbouring countries. Estonia lists its fossil fuel subsidies, no phase-out is planned. The Commission encourages setting out a roadmap to end these subsidies and gradually phase-out solid fossil fuels in line with just transition commitments. Moving forward, the Commission advises Estonia to further increase support for research and innovation in clean energy technologies to boost competitiveness and meet its future energy needs.
The Commission assessment concludes that Slovakia is on track to meet its Effort Sharing Regulation target of reducing GHG emissions by 22.7% by 2030 compared to 2005, while Slovakia projects to miss it’s targets to increase carbon removals in the LULUCF sector.
Slovakia has slightly increased its renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. The country is ramping up solar and wind energy, making it energy system more secure and sustainable. On energy efficiency, Slovakia plans to retrofit public and private buildings and improve energy performance across sectors.
On energy security, Slovakia emphasises the need for grid interconnections and cross-border energy trade to stabilise energy supply and integrate more renewable energy. The Commission invites Slovakia to do more to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels, particularly coal and natural gas, and further diversify its energy sources.
With the updated final NECPs, EU countries have set out their policy and investment initiatives up to 2030. Efforts should now also turn to implementation and delivery: using public funds to de-risk investments, unlock private finance and coordinate measures at regional and European level.
The Commission will continue to work with EU countries as they address remaining gaps, mobilise funding and detail their actions on climate and energy policy. The Commission will assess whether further measures are needed to ensure collective target achievement, notably on renewable energy and energy efficiency.
On 28 May, the Commission published an EU-wide assessment (COM/2025/274) and a Staff Working Document (SWD/2025/140) with the individual assessment of 23 national plans already submitted, taking account of informal indications from those missing. The remaining EU countries which have not yet submitted their final plans – Belgium and Poland – are encouraged do so without further delay. The Commission will then assess the plans.
The submission of the final updated NECPs is a legal obligation for the EU countries under the Governance Regulation. Belgium and Poland are the only 2 EU countries that have still not submitted their final updated plans to the Commission. Infringement procedures are ongoing and reasoned opinions were issued in March 2025. The Commission is analysing the replies received and is intending to use the available legal options to ensure compliance with EU legislation whenever necessary and appropriate. Established in the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, updating the NECPs is a key process for EU countries to set out how they plan to meet the EU’s 2030 climate and energy targets and Energy Union objectives."

Commission proposes a targeted amendment of EU rules on road tolls and user charges to clarify and simplify certain provisions,https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/commission-proposes-targeted-amendment-eu-rules-road-tolls-and-user-charges-clarify-and-simplify-2025-10-02_en,2 October 2025,"The Commission presented an amended proposal to make certain provisions of the eurovignette directive clearer, simpler and more precise.","Today the European Commission presented an amended proposal to make certain provisions of its legislation on road tolls and user charges (Directive 1999/62/EC, also known as the eurovignette directive) clearer, simpler and more precise. Today’s proposal updates the existing proposal to take into account the latest legislative developments of the legal framework regulating the CO2 emissions performance of heavy-duty vehicles, while preserving its original aim. This proposal contributes to achieving the goal of maintaining a consistent and high-quality EU legal framework. It grants greater legal clarity and certainty, allowing national administrations and businesses to clearly understand their rights and obligations.
The proposal will now be considered by the European Parliament and the Council under the ordinary legislative procedure.
Directive 1999/62/EC regulates the imposition of tolls and user charges for the use of road infrastructure. The directive is based on the ‘polluter pays’ principle and the ‘user pays’ principle. The ‘polluter pays’ principle allows to set road charges based on the environmental performance of vehicles, in order to steer the renewal of the vehicle fleet in a way that mitigates the negative impacts of road transport on the environment. Directive (EU) 2022/362 amended Directive 1999/62/EC by enabling, among other changes, road charging on the basis of the CO2 emissions of vehicles."
Commissioner Roswall hosts high-level stakeholder roundtable on simplification of environmental laws,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/commissioner-roswall-hosts-high-level-talks-simplifying-laws-2025-10-02_en,2 October 2025,The roundtable will discuss the results of a Call for Evidence on an environmental simplification package that closed in September.,"Commissioner for the Environment, Water Resilience, and a Competitive Circular Economy, Jessika Roswall, is hosting a high-level Stakeholder Roundtable on simplifying environmental laws in Brussels today (2 October).
The roundtable will discuss the results of a Call for Evidence on an environmental simplification package that launched on 22 July and ended on 10 September.
The purpose of the consultation was to identify ways to simplify reporting, permitting and reduce administrative burden. It focused on the areas of the circular economy, industrial emissions, waste management and environmental permitting.
Simplifying and improving EU laws will make rules clearer and easier to understand, and faster and cheaper to implement.
More than 190,000 responses were received, including many specific suggestions on how to cut red tape alongside calls to preserve environmental standards and not weaken them.
Speaking at the opening of the event, Commissioner Roswall said:
""This Commission is committed to simplification. Today’s roundtable enables an open discussion with stakeholders to identify key actions to reduce administrative burden.
What we want to achieve is a leaner legal framework that is easier to implement for businesses and public administration, while staying the course on our environmental objectives. This is crucial for our common goal: fostering Europe’s competitiveness while preserving the environment and safeguarding public health.""
The event brings together a range of business representatives, civil society and think tanks. The Call for Evidence showed that business supports less burdensome regulation that leaves them with flexibility to deliver both growth and sustainable production.
The objective of the environmental simplification initiative is to make it easier to implement environmental laws while avoiding deregulation. The Commission has therefore announced its intention to table legal proposals to simplify environmental rules and improve the efficiency of permitting procedures, allowing businesses to do more for the environment, but at less cost.
The simplification of environmental rules follows on from the  Competitiveness Compass, which sets a clear framework for Europe to become the place where future technologies, services, and clean products are invented, manufactured, and put on the market, while being the first continent to become climate neutral.
One way to achieve this will be the simplification of the regulatory environment. The Compass, therefore, sets the target of cutting administrative burden by at least 25% for all companies and at least 35% for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) without undermining environmental or social policy goals.

Winners of 2027 European Green Cities Awards announced in Vilnius,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/2027-european-green-cities-winners-announced-2025-10-02_en,2 October 2025,"Heilbronn, Germany, won the European Green Capital award, and the European Green Leaf prize went to Assen in the Netherlands and Siena, Italy.","The winners of the two most prestigious European Green Cities Awards for 2027 were announced today (2 Oct) in Vilnius during a festive ceremony held at the Lithuanian National Art Gallery.
In 2027, Heilbronn (Germany) will be the European Green Capital, and the European Green Leaf Awards -  for smaller cities - will go to Assen (the Netherlands) and Siena (Italy).
Speaking on the issue, Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience and a Competitive Circular Economy Jessika Roswall said:
“The European Green Capital and European Green Leaf awards, each year, recognise cities that strive to be at the forefront of urban and environmental sustainability. Cities that – simply put – lead by example.
I am delighted to congratulate Heilbronn, Assen and Siena for having been awarded these titles for 2027. This is both a recognition and responsibility – you are our new ambassadors of the green transition.”
The jury awarded Heilbronn the title of European Green Capital 2027 based on top scores that the city received in air quality, water, noise, climate change adaptation and the circular economy.
Heilbronn demonstrates a successful intersectoral collaboration of noise, climate and air pollution into its ‘Landscape Plan 2030’ and the city’s ‘Mobility Concept’. Citizen engagement is central, with participatory platforms, awareness campaigns, and protection for quiet areas.
The jury also recognised the city’s ambitious targets for 2035, as well as the regional collaborations that Heilbronn has built to further improve air quality and noise reduction.
Heilbronn will succeed 2025 titleholder Vilnius (Lithuania) and 2026 titleholder Guimarães (Portugal).
Both Green Leaf Award winners, Assen and Siena, impressed the jury with their exemplary approaches to engaging their communities in the green transition.
Members of the jury were impressed with Assen’s strong commitment to circularity and climate change mitigation. Its innovative waste management policies, including enhanced PMD (Plastic, Metal, and Drink cartons) collection and initiatives such as Repair Cafés, showcase reducing residual waste and promoting material recovery, which drive forward the circular economy.
The city has achieved significant CO₂ reductions through building retrofits, decarbonisation of municipal operations, and innovative projects like the Energy Garden.
The cycling highway to Groningen is an example of a sustainable mobility project that further highlights Assen’s efforts to reduce emissions.
Siena impressed the jury with its green areas and sustainable land use, as well as effective waste management systems.
The total area of public green areas in Siena has increased thanks to public investment. New urban parks have been created, resulting in an average of 28m2 of public green spaces per capita.
The city recycled an impressive 61.4% of its municipal waste and reduced landfill to just 1%. The jury also recognised the public engagement programs in Siena, which promote reuse, repair, and circular economy practices.
Heilbronn will be granted a financial prize of €600,000. The money will contribute to the city’s effort to implement measures of sustainability and participation to enhance its environmental sustainability as European Green Capital 2027.
Similarly, Assen and Siena, as European Green Leaf 2027 award winners, will receive a financial prize of €200,000 each.
A total of 20 cities from 11 European countries competed for the awards in this edition. An international panel of seven independent urban sustainability experts evaluated each application and proposed a shortlist of seven finalist cities.
All seven finalists were interviewed by a jury comprised of representatives from the Commission, the European Committee of the Regions, the European Environment Agency (EEA), the EU Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, and the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).
The jury also commends the Green Capital finalists Debrecen (Hungary) and Klagenfurt on Lake Wörthersee (Austria) and the Green Leaf finalists Benidorm (Spain) and Saint-Quentin (France) for their outstanding performances. All finalists have shown an impressive commitment to further urban sustainability in their communities.
The EU recognises that cities play a crucial role in delivering a low-carbon, resource-efficient, clean, sustainable and resilient society. With over 70% of Europeans living in urban areas, cities play an important role in the environmental and economic transformation.
The European Green Capital Award was launched in 2010 by the Commission to encourage cities to become greener and cleaner, and thereby to improve the quality of life for their citizens.
The Award recognises cities that are committed to achieving the European Green Deal’s ambitious goals and more specifically the Zero Pollution Action Plan, the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Biodiversity Strategy, the EU Adaptation Strategy and the EU goals on climate neutrality.
The European Green Leaf Award was established to recognise the environmental efforts and achievements of smaller towns and cities (20,000 – 100,000 inhabitants).
Being a European Green Capital or a European Green Leaf city brings many benefits, from increasing the city’s profile to building new alliances. Winning also creates a spirit of optimism, attracting investments and building a better quality of life for citizens.

Ocean acidification: Seventh planetary boundary now crossed,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/ocean-acidification-seventh-planetary-boundary-now-crossed-2025-10-02_en,2 October 2025,A new report reveals how seven out of nine critical planetary boundaries that keep life on Earth stable and healthy have been crossed.,"A groundbreaking global scientific report has revealed a stark truth: we have now crossed seven out of nine critical planetary boundaries that keep life on Earth stable and healthy.
The newest boundary breached is ocean acidification — a dangerous shift caused mainly by rising carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels. This change is altering the very chemistry of our ocean, putting all marine life at risk, but especially fragile coral reefs that are already struggling under the weight of warming temperatures and pollution.
The latest EU Copernicus Ocean State Report highlights mounting threats to Europe’s seas from acidification, plastic pollution, and climate change — sounding a clear alarm for urgent and stronger protective actions, while the European Environment Agency (EEA) is warning of the ‘deadly trio’ of acidification, deoxygenation and warming temperatures for our seas and ocean.
Scientists warn that crossing planetary boundaries puts the Earth’s life-support systems at serious risk. Now, more than ever, coordinated efforts at global, regional, and local levels are critical to protect our seas and ocean — the vital blue heart that sustains life on our planet.
In a historic step forward, the recent ratification of the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) agreement creates a global framework to conserve and sustainably manage marine life in international waters. This milestone works hand in hand with the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), which sets bold targets to preserve ocean ecosystems and reduce pollution on a worldwide scale.
Closer to home, the Commission is taking action through its EU Water Resilience Strategy, which focuses on integrated water management to boost the resilience of our waters and ocean against acidification and other climate impacts.
With its Ocean Pact, the Commission has committed to an integrated approach to the protection of marine ecosystems, including against the impacts of climate change, and the development of a sustainable, decarbonised and circular Blue Economy.
The Commission is also revising the Marine Strategy Framework Directive – one of the most ambitious marine environmental protection laws worldwide. The review will seek to better address the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems in EU law.
With its Plastics Strategy, the EU also aims to dramatically reduce marine litter and will continue global efforts towards an international Plastics Treaty. Meanwhile, ambitious climate policies target cutting CO2 emissions — the root cause of ocean acidification.
The planetary boundaries framework identifies nine essential Earth system processes that regulate the planet’s stability, resilience, and ability to support life. These boundaries define safe limits for human activities, beyond which we risk triggering catastrophic environmental changes.
Since its introduction in 2009, the framework has helped spotlight critical areas like climate change, biodiversity loss, land-use change, freshwater use, and chemical pollution — all vital to maintaining a balanced and healthy Earth."

This is the idea behind the EU-funded project The Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive and man-made disaster training in Latvia.
At the heart of the project lies the Fire Safety and Civil Protection College training ground - an innovative training centre equipped with cutting-edge simulators that recreate real-life disasters. This offers invaluable practical experience in a safe environment. The training space includes a house designed for practicing high-risk maneuvers as well as a labyrinth and underground tunnel to learn to overcome various obstacles. For example, fire-fighters and rescuers learn how to extinguish various types of fires and conduct rescue operations in one place. The training ground is compact and transformable, allowing for training based on various scenarios.
According to the Latvian State Fire and Rescue Service, project has been a game-changer for national security and disaster response. It helps to prepare teams to respond to emergencies more efficiently and effectively. Besides EU funding, the project was supported by other sources, including the U.S. Embassy’s Office of Defence Cooperation. This support has been crucial in renovating existing buildings, modernising facilities, and strengthening international collaboration.
The project offers more than just new facilities. Trainees, whether they are cadets of the Fire Safety and Civil Protection College or professionals from the State Fire and Rescue Service, gain skills to respond to emergencies faster and smarter.

The recent appalling  attack against a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur reminds us all of the relevance to counter antisemitism, including at EU level. According to the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), there is no universally agreed-upon legal definition of antisemitism that is binding on all nations. The ECRI also considers antisemitism to be one of many forms of racism, such as antiblack racism, anti-gypsyism, and anti-Asian racism, as well as hatred linked to religion or belief, such as anti-Muslim hatred¹. Nonetheless, some scholars argue that antisemitism is a form of discrimination based on a perceived Jewish identity.
This issue also explores the ideological fluidity observed among perpetrators across the full ideological extremist spectrum, including jihadist, violent right wing, and violent left wing extremist groups. Each author employs their own interdisciplinary and varied theoretical and methodological frameworks, a practice that highlights their individual research models and approaches. It starts by delving into the extreme case of antisemitism within prisons, which mirrors broader societal trends. The issue also examines the role of transnational networks and calls for new, coordinated approaches similar to those used against organised crime.

The report confirms cycling’s role as a clean, affordable and health-boosting way to travel.","The European Commission today adopted its first progress report on the European declaration on cycling, showing strong momentum across the EU to boost cycling infrastructure and policies. The report confirms cycling’s role as a clean, affordable and health-boosting way to travel.
Cycling could help tackle transport poverty by offering low-cost mobility. The Commission’s recent recommendation invites Member States to expand infrastructure and provide subsidies for bicycles, e-bikes and cargo bikes, especially for low-income households.
The EU-funded 'Cycling counts' study is mapping cycling infrastructure. Preliminary results point to over 900,000 km of cycle paths across Europe, with major differences between regions. A new network of national cycling contact points (26 Member States) and the expert group on urban mobility have identified more than 270 measures.
From 2021–2027, €4.5 billion is earmarked for cycling, including €3.2 billion from EU funds. This will deliver over 12,000 km of new or upgraded cycle paths. An estimated €1.3 billion under the recovery and resilience facility is earmarked for cycling-related projects.
Cities are stepping up cycling measures to meet the targets of the climate-neutral and smart cities mission. At national level, inspired by the European declaration, Lithuania adopted its first cycling strategy in 2024.
The report highlights the need to improve aspects such as cycle logistics, safe parking, charging in buildings, carriage of bikes on trains, climate-proofing infrastructure and engagement with industry.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas said: ""Cycling is much more than just a means of transport. It contributes to cleaner air, healthier communities, and more accessible and people-friendly cities. Europe is steadily expanding cycling opportunities, but we need to go further to ensure that everyone has access to safe, affordable, and convenient mobility options.""
The European declaration on cycling, signed in 2024 by the European Parliament, Council and Commission, recognises cycling as a fully-fledged mode of transport. It sets principles for action onplanning, infrastructure, inclusivity, multimodality, investments, safety,industry and better data. Today’s report is the first stocktake of progress since its adoption."

Gathering Agriculture, Environment, and Fisheries ministers from the EU Baltic countries, along with European Parliament representatives and regional stakeholders, to address the pressing environmental and socio-economic challenges affecting the Baltic Sea.
The conference focused on the interconnected pressures of climate change, eutrophication, misreporting possibly leading to overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. All these stressors are contributing to the deteriorating health of this vital marine ecosystem. The discussions underscored the need for a comprehensive and coordinated response to ensure the sustainable management of Baltic Sea resources.
The event also highlighted the urgent need to address the declining fish stocks in the Baltic Sea, which are critical to the livelihoods of fishers and local communities. It is crucial to ensure effective fisheries management measures to protect the economic and cultural heritage of coastal communities that rely on fishing.
Considering the pressing challenges, it is crucial to support relevant scientific institutes with both financial and human resources, enabling them to undertake necessary research and provide robust scientific advice.
The Commission highlighted the importance of implementing existing legislation, including fisheries control, to effectively prevent misreporting. By ensuring accurate catch registration and adherence to EU legislation, we can significantly support the recovery and resilience of fish stocks.
Key outcomes of the conference included a commitment to revise the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to enhance its effectiveness and the implementation of the Nature Restoration Regulation to regenerate marine habitats and species. Additionally, the conference highlighted the role of the Water Resilience Strategy and the European Ocean Pact in promoting sustainable blue economies in the region.
The conference also addressed the issue of eutrophication, a significant problem in the Baltic Sea caused by nutrient runoff. Measures under the Water Framework Directive and the revised Urban Wastewater Directive were discussed as vital components for reducing nutrient influx and achieving a healthier Baltic Sea.
As part of the broader EU efforts, the conference underscored the importance of regional governance through the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) to coordinate efforts at the basin level. The EU will continue to support these initiatives through co-funding and dedicated projects aimed at restoring coastal habitats.
The European Commission remains determined to lead these efforts, working together with Member States and regional partners for a sustainable and prosperous Baltic Sea.
More than 85 million people live around the Baltic Sea basin. The Baltic Sea is the most polluted sea in Europe, affected, amongst others, by biodiversity loss, climate change, eutrophication, and elevated levels of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and litter, in particular plastic waste.
In 2023, the second ‘Our Baltic Conference' took place, during which ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment of the Baltic Sea EU Member States committed to safely clean and manage submerged munitions in the Baltic Sea, making it more sustainable for the generations to come. The Commission joined these important efforts by providing €2 million for the mapping of unexploded munitions in the Baltic Sea.
In 2020, a first ‘Our Baltic Conference' took place, during which ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment of the Baltic Sea EU Member States adopted a declaration whereby they committed to boost efforts to bring the Baltic to a good environmental status. More particularly, the Member States pledged to enhance cooperation to prevent overfishing and to better address pollution, including from agriculture, marine litter, contaminants as well as sunken ships and munitions.
European Commissioner for Fisheries and Oceans Costas Kadis said: ""This conference has reaffirmed our commitment to the Baltic Sea. We are not willing to gamble with the future of our fishers or our ecosystems. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management is essential for accelerating recovery and ensuring long-term sustainability"".
European Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience, and a Competitive Circular Economy Jessika Roswall said: ""The environmental, economic, and security challenges facing the Baltic Sea are interconnected. Addressing them together is vital to the EU's strategic autonomy and resilience. We have the tools to tackle these challenges, and now, we need to implement them""."

EU electricity trading in the day-ahead markets becomes more dynamic,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-electricity-trading-day-ahead-markets-becomes-more-dynamic-2025-10-01_en,1 October 2025,"On 30 September 2025, the EU’s day-ahead electricity market moved from hourly to 15-minute trading intervals.","On 30 September 2025, the EU’s day-ahead electricity market moved from hourly to 15-minute trading intervals. The 15-minute market time unit is part of the Single-Day Ahead Coupling (SDAC), the system that connects day-ahead electricity markets across EU countries. Thanks to the change, electricity prices will now be calculated every 15 minutes, reflecting more accurately the expected electricity generation and demand in the electricity system.
This shift makes Europe’s electricity system more flexible, reliable and ready for the growing share of renewable energy. This finer granularity is particularly important for variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar as it improves their ability to integrate into the electricity grid and participate in the electricity markets. It also allows system operators to better forecast and balance supply and demand of electricity, enhancing the reliability of the grid and ensuring a stable access to electricity. Market participants also benefit from greater flexibility as they can now place orders in 15-minute intervals, leading to more efficient market outcomes.
For EU consumers and industry, the benefits are expected to be significant. A more responsive electricity system means better use of renewable electricity, fewer imbalances in the grid and ultimately lower costs linked to managing electricity flows. This shift also supports the EU’s climate and energy goals by making it easier to integrate clean energy into daily electricity consumption.
The transition from hourly to 15-minute trading in day-ahead and intraday markets is envisaged in the Electricity Regulation (EU/2019/943). The implementation in the day-ahead markets has required significant adaptations to the functioning of the SDAC and has been made possible thanks to the concerted efforts by EU nominated electricity market operators, transmission system operators, industry stakeholders, national regulators and the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators.
The 15-minute trading in the Single Intraday Coupling was also completed with the addition of the Greek bidding zone borders on the same date."
European Union detains 112 million counterfeit items worth €3.8 billion in 2024,https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/news/european-union-detains-112-million-counterfeit-items-worth-eu38-billion-2024-2025-10-01_en,1 October 2025,"In 2024, EU authorities in the internal market and at the EU border intercepted 112 million counterfeit goods with an estimated retail value of €3.8 billion","These figures, published by the European Commission and the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), reflect the ongoing strength of coordinated enforcement efforts across customs, police, and market surveillance authorities in all EU Member States.
Customs authorities detained about 20 million articles at the EU border, with an estimated value of €1.5 billon, representing a ten-year high.
However, the report also shows the current challenges authorities face including a significant surge in trade volumes—particularly in e-commerce—and evolving geopolitical dynamics and global crises. The Customs Reform will play a key role in addressing these challenges.
Fighting counterfeits in Europe
112 million fake items seized in 2024
Estimated retailed value: €3,8 billion
Seized products ranged from toys, perfumes, cosmetics, clothing, CDs/DVDs (including software) to newer categories such as e-cigarettes and vaping devices.
While the total number of items seized is lower than the exceptional record set in 2023, this year still marks the second highest in the series. Compared to 2022, detentions in 2024 are up by over 30%, underscoring the persistent scale and complexity of intellectual property (IP) infringement across both physical and digital marketplaces.
Notably, despite fewer items being detained, the estimated value of detentions in 2024 reached its highest recorded level. This apparent increase is attributed to higher unit prices of the counterfeit goods seized, reflecting a shift in the nature and market impact of IP-infringing products.
Counterfeit goods continue to threaten consumer safety, fair competition, and innovation—ranging from traditional items such as clothing, toys, body care items such as perfumes and cosmetics, and recorded CDs/DVDs (including software) to newer categories like e-cigarettes and vaping devices.
Top categories by number of detained articles
Emerging technologies are fuelling the proliferation of more sophisticated counterfeits, while rising demand for application software and retro-gaming content has ignited a surge in copyright-infringing counterfeits.
In 2024, the authorities from 7 Member States generated 90% of the volume and value of counterfeit goods detained. Specifically:
Overall, the report highlights the need for an urgent update of the enforcement system, be it to keep citizens safe from potentially dangerous products or protect domestic industry from theft of intellectual property.
Compared to 2022, seizures rose by more than 30%.
Despite fewer items than in 2023, the total value reached its highest level ever."
"Munich, Paris and Madrid regions among EU strategic areas for digital R&I",https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/munich-paris-and-madrid-regions-among-eu-strategic-areas-digital-ri-2025-10-01_en,1 October 2025,A new JRC study provides a regional-level analysis of R&I and startups in EU’s digital ecosystem.,"The top 10 most strategic regions for R&I in the EU are spread across nine different Member States. The study uses economic indicators to investigate the progress in competitiveness and support policy initiatives on closing the divide between EU and its global competitors. At EU level, the analysis can inform efforts to support and finance startups and scaleups.
The study offers a unique picture of the R&I landscape in the digital ecosystem, and allows to identify which regions are more strategic, both globally and at EU level. The strategic importance of regions is assessed with the analysis of:
The study identifies nearly 6,500 research organisations, concentrated around major European cities like Barcelona, Paris and Berlin.
The intermediation indicator shows which regions are vital nodes for knowledge exchange and collaboration in the digital ecosystem on R&I. This is assessed both at global level (considering the rest of the world as unique entity) as well as at the EU-level.
Results show how some EU regions play a key role both in the global and in the EU-only network, while some others cover a more specialised position.
In both approaches, at global and EU-level, the top three most strategic regions are München, Kreisfreie Stadt, in Germany, Paris in France and Madrid in Spain. However, while München is the most strategic region at global level, its position is weaker – ranking third - when considering only EU-regions, mainly in relation to its well-developed patenting activities.
Paris in France and Madrid in Spain, are in the top three positions with both approaches, with a leading role when considering only EU regions. This is due to several EU funded projects that entail intra-EU as well as international collaborations.
Some regions, such as Stockholm and Dresden, are more globally strategic due to their international co-patenting activities. Other regions, like Brussels, Barcelona, Milan, and Zuidoost-Noord-Brabant, are pivotal within the EU due to their intra-EU project collaborations.
A focus on the top EU regions in terms of GDP and employment-to-population ratio can unveil the economic environment in which the regions operate. The study suggests also how the presence of startups focusing on R&I activities in those regions can be interpreted as an opportunity for business. The bubble size of figure below corresponds to the number of startups identified in that region carrying out R&I activities.
Paris region stands out with high values of GDP per capita and employment-to-population ratio, in contrast with Madrid, which has lower metrics in these areas. München finds itself in an intermediate position. Despite these economic disparities, Paris, München and Madrid maintain a consistent presence of research and innovation (R&I) startups.
The lack of R&I startup presence in regions such as Erlagen, in The Netherlands, and Brussels-Hoofdstad, in Belgium, suggests potential for innovation and investment.
Overall, this study provides a first set of evidence that can inform the development of tailored policies and initiatives to enhance innovation-led growth in different regions, ultimately contributing to the competitiveness of the EU as a whole.
By understanding the regional dynamics of R&I, the EU can better address the innovation divide between its regions and global competitors, aligning with the goals of the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy.
In May 2025, the Commission launched the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy, which aims to make Europe a great place to launch and grow global technology-driven, innovative companies. Analysing research, innovation, and startups presence in the digital ecosystem is crucial to understand the landscape on which this strategy will play its effects.
This study is based on the analysis of the Digital Techno-Economic ecoSystem (DGTES). A first application of the DGTES methodology has been used to analyse the 14 industrial ecosystems identified by the European New Industrial Strategy, among which the Digital ecosystem.
The analysis of this study is made on NUTS-3 regions. The NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) is the official classification developed by the EU, and NUTS-3 refers to the small regions identified in each Member State for statistical purposes.

Moving to a digital world has brought with it many opportunities, but also many challenges, one of which is cybersecurity. During the month of October, various activities take place across Europe, as part of the EU’s annual campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among EU citizens and organisations.
The campaign, which is coordinated by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the Commission and EU countries, brings together hundreds of partners from Europe and beyond. You can take part in conferences, workshops, trainings, webinars, presentations and more, to raise awareness and share good practices. Check what’s happening near you.
Cyberattacks are used to steal data, spy on users, disable or manipulate computers and more. They not only target personal computers, but also entire networks, and can be carried out by individual hackers, groups of hackers or even countries. There are many different ways you can protect yourself against these threats:
🔒 manage your passwords
🗃️ back up your data
🪪adjust your privacy settings and
🦹 protect yourself against social engineering.
At EU level, the EU addresses these challenges by actively promoting cybersecurity through the EU Cybersecurity Strategy. This strategy underpins the EU’s efforts to tackle cybersecurity threats and focuses on strengthening our cybersecurity and our response to cyberattacks.
More recently in January 2025, the Commission presented an EU action plan to strengthen the cybersecurity of hospitals and healthcare providers. Its aim is to create a safer and more secure environment for patients. Read more about what the EU is doing here.

The regulation was proposed by the Commission in November 2023 to enhance Europol's support for Member States' law enforcement authorities.
Key achievements include:
The regulation will need to be formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council and published in the Official Journal of the EU.
The Management Board of Europol will have to adopt implementing rules on how the European Centre Against Migrant Smuggling operates.
In her 2025 State of the Union address, President von der Leyen announced new initiatives to step up the fight against smugglers and traffickers, including “a new sanctions regime to freeze their assets, restrict their freedom of movement and deprive them of their profits.”
The new European Internal Security Strategy, ProtectEU, also announced that the Commission will propose an ambitious overhaul of Europol's mandate, in close consultation with Member States. The aim will be to further strengthen Europol's role in investigating cross-border, large-scale, and complex cases posing a serious threat to the internal security of the Union; working more closely with other EU Agencies and further enhancing support to Member States.
The proposal for a Regulation on strengthening the role of Europol against migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings was put forward in November 2023, together with a proposal fa Directive to establish minimum rules to prevent and counter the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and stay in the Union, which is currently under negotiation with the European Parliament and the Council. In November 2023 the Commission also launched the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling, to step up cooperation with international partners and break the smugglers' business model."

This meeting marks the first encounter between Commissioner Brunner and the Expert Group, which plays a major role in advising the European Commission on migration policies from the perspective of migrants.
The Expert Group, composed of representatives of migrant organisations or migration experts in their personal capacity, provides invaluable insights to the Commission on the design and implementation of migration policies. As most experts have lived migration experience themselves, the expert group’s contributions help ensuring that EU policies are effective and address real needs.
Commissioner Brunner opened the two-day meeting, outlining the Commission’s priorities around migration under the current mandate and underlining how the expert group could play an important role in their implementation.
The discussion then focused on the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum, resettlement, and the protection of migrant workers’ rights.
The Expert Group was established in late 2020 as part of the Action Plan on Integration and Inclusion 2021-2027. It consists of 22 experts, most of whom have a migrant background, providing firsthand experience of the issues migrants face. The Group has been instrumental in providing feedback on a diverse range of migration-related topics, including asylum procedures, trafficking in human beings, legal pathways, integration, and the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum.
The discussions held by the Expert Group allow testing of policy ideas and approaches against real-world experiences, seeking evidence and learning about good practices. The Group serves as a testbed for novel approaches and counts as a stakeholder consultation in accordance with the Better Regulation guidelines."

Commission carries out unannounced antitrust inspections in the vaccines sector,https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/about/news/commission-carries-out-unannounced-antitrust-inspections-vaccines-sector-2025-09-30_en,30 September 2025,The Commission has concerns that the inspected company may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit abuses of a dominant market position (Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).,"The European Commission is carrying out unannounced inspections at the premises of a company active in the vaccines sector.
The Commission has concerns that the inspected company may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit abuses of a dominant market position (Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). In particular, the Commission is investigating possible exclusionary practices that may amount to anticompetitive disparagement.
The Commission officials were accompanied by their counterparts from the relevant national competition authorities.
Background
Unannounced inspections are a preliminary investigative step into suspected anticompetitive practices. The fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the company in question is guilty of anti-competitive behaviour, nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself. The Commission respects the rights of defence, in particular the right of companies to be heard in antitrust proceedings.
There is no legal deadline to complete inquiries into anticompetitive conduct. Their duration depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of each case, the extent to which the companies concerned cooperate with the Commission and the parties' exercise of their rights of defence.
The Commission has recently concluded two other antitrust investigations into anticompetitive disparagement in the pharmaceutical sector, in cases AT.40588 Teva Copaxone and AT.40577 Vifor.

Ukraine successfully completes its screening process,https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/ukraine-successfully-completes-its-screening-process-2025-09-30_en,30 September 2025,"Today, Ukraine has reached an important milestone on its EU accession path with the completion of the bilateral screening with the European Commission. The bilateral screening began in July 2024","Today, Ukraine has reached an important milestone on its EU accession path with the completion of the bilateral screening with the European Commission. The bilateral screening began in July 2024, and the rapid completion was made possible by Ukraine’s dedication, professionalism and motivation to deliver on reforms, align with EU standards, and join the EU family. Achieving this in the midst of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is a remarkable demonstration of the country’s resilience and determination.
The screening process shows that accession negotiations are a whole-of-society exercise. It involves the entire public administration, with topics ranging from food safety standards, clean water or support to farmers being discussed. It is a key part of EU accession negotiations, and its successful conclusion brings Ukraine one step closer to EU accession.
During the bilateral screening, the Commission and Ukraine carried out a thorough examination of each policy field (also known as negotiation chapters) and Ukraine’s compliance with the EU acquis in each area, and Ukraine set out clear plans to align with the rules. This process enables the Commission to determine how well-prepared Ukraine is for membership and forms an important technical basis for further progress in the negotiations.
The Commission presents the results of the screening to Member States in screening reports, in which it can recommend that they open negotiations in the relevant policy fields.
Once Member States agree, the negotiation chapters, which are part of broader thematic clusters, can be opened. Ukraine is expected to continue its reform efforts, align with EU legislation and strengthen its institutional and administrative capacity, guided by the benchmarks to be set by the Member States. Cluster 1 on the fundamentals – such as the rule of law, fundamental rights and functioning democratic institutions – is always the first to be opened and the last to be closed.

The election results confirm the people’s enduring support for the European future of the Republic of Moldova, as enshrined in its Constitution. The voters have given a clear and strong mandate to continue the Republic of Moldova’s determined engagement towards EU membership.
According to the preliminary findings and conclusions of the OSCE/ODIHR, these elections were competitive, offered clear political alternatives, and were well organized, supported by a sound legal framework. Newly implemented laws and candidate eligibility requirements caused some issues, although the Central Electoral Commission has been forthcoming in solving them. The electoral campaign and the voting itself took place in a context of unprecedented and multi-faceted interference and pressure from Russia, as also noted by OSCE/ODIHR.
The EU strongly condemns relentless hybrid attacks by Russia and its proxies aimed at undermining the rule of law and democratic process in the Republic of Moldova, fostering destabilization in the country and fuelling polarization through massive use of disinformation, vote-buying, cyber-attacks, and training of violent provocateurs. We commend the citizens of the Republic of Moldova for their resilience and determination to resist Moscow’s malign interference and for safeguarding their choice. The EU also commends the relevant institutions of Republic of Moldova for their efforts in ensuring the integrity of the elections, despite sustained external manipulation and pressure.
The EU looks forward to working closely with the new Parliament and incoming Government to advance EU accession and the implementation of the Reform Agenda, as well as enhancing the country’s resilience and economic growth.
The future of the Republic of Moldova and its citizens lies within the European Union. We commend the Republic of Moldova for the quality and fast pace of its accession-related reforms and welcome the significant progress achieved so far. We stand ready to take the next steps in the accession process in line with the merit-based approach, and to further advance the accession negotiations."

Making Europe’s savings work: Better investment opportunities for European citizens to strengthen the European economy,https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/news/making-europes-savings-work-better-investment-opportunities-european-citizens-strengthen-european-2025-09-30_en,30 September 2025,The European Commission announced a major initiative to advance the Savings and Investments Union and deliver tangible benefits for all citizens across the EU.,"The comprehensive package introduces a blueprint for Savings and Investment Accounts (SIAs) – a tool aimed at making investing simpler and more accessible for everyone.
A crucial component of securing financial independence is the possibility for citizens to manage savings better and build wealth over time, including by investing in capital markets. EU citizens have one of the highest savings rates in the world, yet they often do not get the most out of their savings. This is due to a combination of factors. While it is necessary to improve financial literacy, citizens also need simple and accessible investment opportunities.
To address this, the package includes a blueprint on Savings and Investment Accounts (SIAs), in the form of a Commission Recommendation to Member States.
SIAs are comparable to special bank accounts, offered by financial institutions and services providers, such as banks, which allow citizens (retail investors) to invest in capital markets instruments. These accounts often come with tax incentives and simplified tax procedures, making them an attractive option for citizens.
Savings and Investment Accounts (SIAs) could foster a stronger investment culture among EU citizens and have the potential to transform how Europeans engage with investment and capital markets. The European Commission aims to foster a stronger investment culture in the EU. The SIAs can enable citizens to achieve higher returns on their savings, helping them to prepare better for major life objectives, such as buying a home, funding their children’s higher education or planning for retirement- all while maintaining full control over which financial products or economic sectors they choose to invest in.
By moving some of their savings into productive investments, citizens can also facilitate the financing of businesses, thereby driving economic growth and job creation across Europe, in line with the Savings and Investments Union objectives.
In some EU countries, SIAs have already proven hugely successful. In others, they exist but lack the features or incentives to make them attractive. On 30 September 2025, the Commission is recommending that Member States introduce SIAs where they do not yet exist and enhance existing schemes by incorporating best practices from across Europe and worldwide.
Drawing on these successful experiences, the Commission considers that SIA should include several key features to benefit citizens and the European economy alike:
Citizen investment
The European Commission will closely monitor the take-up of its recommendation on a Savings and Investment Account to ensure that Europe's citizens feel confident managing their money, saving better and thriving financially.
Wopke Hoekstra, Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth in charge of taxation said:
The Savings and Investments Union (SIU) is an important step for EU’s economy. This is good for our capital markets, for people’s financial future, for sustainable growth and innovation. With interesting tax incentives, people are more encouraged to invest in higher-return investments, which in turn will help us find growth capital and be more competitive.

The European Commission welcomes the publication of the ninth edition of the Copernicus Ocean State Report, published by the Copernicus Marine Service of the EU Space Programme. Every part of the ocean is now under threat, impacted by the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, the report shows.
This annual report documents changes across the ocean that affect ecosystems, food production, economies, human communities, and the regulation of regional and global climates.
With ocean warming accelerating, the Earth is reaching dangerous levels of imbalance, approaching the limits of the climate’s safe operating space. Marine biodiversity hotspots are increasingly at risk, acidifying faster than the global average. Ocean warming and acidification critically threaten endangered species and corals, while plastic pollution affects all ocean basins.
“The findings of the Ocean State Report are an alarming reminder of the pressing challenges facing our oceans. At the same time, as European, I am reassured that Europe has a leading role in observing and forecasting different ocean state parameters though the unique Union-owned Copernicus Earth observation system and its services, in particular the marine service. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the global ocean’s state, trends, and natural variations, while showcasing innovative monitoring tools that enable sustainable coexistence with marine ecosystems. This fully supports the European Ocean Pact priorities, making the report a substantial contribution to the European ambitions in stewarding our oceans.” said Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius.
Key findings from this year’s report:
“The conclusions of the Ocean State Report reveal a difficult but essential diagnosis of our ocean. It confirms the triple planetary crisis is not a future threat, but a present reality in our basins. This also means that we have taken the first necessary steps, as data is at the foundation of effective action. In line with the Ocean Pact’s Ocean Observation Initiative, we are leveraging the power of the European Digital Twin of the Ocean, built on marine knowledge assets like Copernicus Marine and EMODnet, to transform data into predictability, allowing us to move from observation to solution.

Two new proposals focus on improving financial literacy at all stages of life and introducing a blueprint for an easy and accessible investment tool.
Financial literacy strategy
Less than 20% of EU citizens have a high level of financial literacy, according to a recent survey. The new strategy aims to enhance citizens’ financial awareness and support EU countries in improving financial literacy, through
EU citizens have one of the highest savings rates in the world but often do not get the most out of their savings. With the right knowledge and skills, they can make sound financial decisions, budget better, avoid scams and fraud, save more efficiently and feel better equipped to invest for their future.
Savings and investment accounts
Citizens also need simple and accessible investment opportunities. Savings and investment accounts (SIAs) are designed to provide them with an easy and user-friendly way to grow their wealth and achieve their personal financial goals.
SIAs are accounts provided by authorised financial services providers which enable retail investors to invest in capital markets. Thanks to tax incentives and simplified tax procedures, they’re an attractive option for citizens who want to invest. Through SIAs, citizens can achieve higher returns on their savings compared to keeping them in bank deposits and choose which financial products and economic sectors to invest in. By doing so, they also help finance EU businesses, driving economic growth and job creation across Europe.
SIAs already exist in some EU countries. The Commission is now recommending that all EU countries introduce them. SIAs should have these key features
The Commission will work closely with EU countries and stakeholders to implement these measures. Europe's citizens should feel confident managing their money and savings, have better access to investment opportunities and thrive financially.

The agreements set out shared priorities, concrete actions, and governance to guide bi-regional cooperation in the years ahead.","Today, representatives from the European Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) adopted a Ministerial Declaration and a New Agenda for Cooperation in Research and Innovation. The agreements set out shared priorities, concrete actions, and governance to guide bi-regional cooperation in the years ahead.
Ekaterina Zaharieva, European Commissioner for Startups, Research, and Innovation said:
“Both sides of the Atlantic are facing similar challenges in climate, health and digital technologies. With the details and the clear roadmap agreed today, we will support our scientists and researchers and turn this partnership into concrete results for our people and economies”.
Work will start immediately with the launch of dedicated Working Groups on health, climate change, environmental sustainability and energy transition, and artificial intelligence in science. These groups, open to voluntary participation from EU and CELAC countries, will prepare 18-month action plans to put these commitments into practice.
Both regions will oversee the work of these groups and ensure implementation of the agreed priorities. Their coordination will be supported by a permanent mechanism linking the European Commission and the CELAC Pro Tempore Presidency. Ministers will reconvene every two years to review progress, agree on new priorities and provide strategic steer of the bi-regional cooperation.
In 2023, during the EU–CELAC Summit, ministers adopted a joint Declaration and endorsed the New EU–LAC Agenda, giving fresh political momentum to cooperation between the two regions. The agenda called for a dedicated Ministerial meeting on research and innovation to turn that momentum into concrete actions.
Today’s EU–CELAC Research and Innovation Ministerial was the first meeting of its kind. The meeting was co-chaired by Ekaterina Zaharieva, European Commissioner for Startups, Research, and Innovation.
This year’s meeting also feeds directly into the preparations for the CELAC–EU Summit in Santa Marta, Colombia, on 9–10 November 2025, where both regions will take stock of achievements during these months and reaffirm their shared commitment to deepen cooperation.
Over the years, the EU has already supported numerous bi-regional cooperation initiatives. Under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, more than 1,800 projects have involved partners from Latin America and the Caribbean, in areas such as renewable energy, climate research, bioeconomy and digital innovation.

Developed under the Cooperation Agreement between EUROCONTROL and the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Climate Action (DG CLIMA), the first version of NEATS is now available for aircraft operators. It enables them to provide data that they measured and/or monitored (‘primary data’), which serve as inputs to the models required to calculate the non-CO2 impact of flights.
Aircraft operators have already tested the system by uploading files and exploring its functions. They can now set up accounts and input primary data such as flight trajectories, engine identifiers, aircraft mass and fuel flow.
The next releases of NEATS are planned to be made available by the end of the year, completing the MRV framework. Version two will allow for business validation of primary data and the non-CO2 aviation effects calculations, while version three will add further reporting capabilities. The third version will also introduce dedicated interfaces for the aircraft operators, verifiers and competent authorities. Updated user guidance for NEATS will be made available in conjunction with the upcoming updates of the tool.
NEATS is a key step towards a formalised and coherent process to address aviation’s full climate impact and improve the sector’s sustainability. By streamlining and, where possible, automating the monitoring, reporting and verification process for non-CO2 aviation effects - such as contrails and nitrogen oxides (NOx) - the tool will support the implementation of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Directive and reinforce the EU’s role as a global leader in climate innovation.

The three-day conference will be one of the biggest urban mobility events in Europe. It will bring together policymakers, local government representatives, NGOs, academics, urban transport experts, industry representatives, as well as residents. The event is organised by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport together with Vilnius Mobility Agency JUDU.
Magda Kopczyńska, Director-General for Mobility and Transport: ""I am delighted to join this year’s Urban Mobility Days. With 75% of Europeans living in cities, investing in urban mobility is more important than ever. This year’s focus on integrating cities into the trans-European transport network, advancing the European Cycling Declaration, and ensuring accessibility for all reflects our ambition for cleaner, more inclusive and connected mobility. Public transport will remain the backbone of sustainable urban transport. Vilnius, as European Green Capital 2025, is the perfect setting for these forward-looking discussions, and I am pleased that colleagues from Ukraine are also part of this shared European journey.""
""Vilnius hosting one of the biggest urban mobility conference in Europe is not only an honor but also a responsibility. It shows that our city is one of the most advanced in sustainable mobility in Europe, and the title of ‘European Green Capital 2025’ further emphasizes our commitment to sustainable urban development. This conference provides an opportunity to share our experience with other cities, strengthens Vilnius’ international image, attracts investment and partnerships, and opens new opportunities for both residents and businesses. We are ready to show how innovative transport systems and integrated public transport can become part of every Vilnius citizen’s daily life,"" says Valdas Benkunskas, Mayor of Vilnius.

European Commission announces €545 million package to scale up renewables in Africa,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2193,27 September 2025,European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled today a €545 million Team Europe package to accelerate Africa's clean energy transition.,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen unveiled today a €545 million Team Europe package to accelerate Africa's clean energy transition. This announcement, made at the Global Citizen Festival via video message in the context of the United Nations General Assembly, is an important milestone in the ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa' campaign, co-hosted with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
This campaign raises global awareness and mobilises public and private investments for clean energy generation and access across Africa.
“The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world. A clean energy transition on the continent will create jobs, stability, growth and the delivery of our global climate goals. The European Union, with the Global Gateway investment plan, is fully committed to supporting Africa on its clean energy path” said President von der Leyen.
Africa's renewable energy potential is huge, yet nearly 600 million people still live without access to electricity. How this clean energy transition unfolds will play a big role in shaping future development, regional stability, and progress on climate change.
Investing now in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power is not just a moral and development imperative, it is also a strategic choice that strengthens supply chains, creates up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, and makes energy systems more resilient. Through the Global Gateway investment strategy, the European Union is helping accelerate this transition, delivering major investments in generation, transmission, and cross-border electricity trade, while building stable international partnerships.
Today's €545 million package expands the EU and Team Europe's clean energy efforts in Africa, with new projects supporting electrification, modernise power grids, and improve access to renewables.
Projects announced include:
The ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa' campaign is carried out with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen and relies on the policy support of the International Energy Agency. It aims to drive new commitments on policy and finance from governments, financial institutions, the private sector and philanthropists. They are encouraged to pledge capital or provide support such as expertise and technical assistance. The campaign will conclude with a high-level event around the G20 summit in South Africa, on 22-23 November 2025.
The campaign also keeps the momentum more broadly towards the ambitious targets of tripling renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency worldwide, set at COP28.
In early October, the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels will bring together governments, financial institutions, and private sector leaders to provide additional support for Africa's clean energy transition. This momentum will carry into the G20 Summit in Johannesburg. World leaders and investors will come together to commit to the partnerships and financing needed to power Africa's renewable future.

This is why the European Union (EU) remains a strong partner of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF), the world’s only fund dedicated to preventing violent extremism.","Experience over recent years has shown that prevention must begin within communities, where trust can be built and root causes addressed.
As the Co-Chair of the Global Counterterrorism Forum, the EU champions multilateralism as the only sustainable path forward. This is why the European Union (EU) remains a strong partner of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund (GCERF), the world’s only fund dedicated to preventing violent extremism. GCERF’s approach invests directly in local civil society, helping communities address vulnerabilities before extremist narratives can take hold.
In its first ten years, GCERF has reached more than 4 million people at risk of radicalisation. At just USD 30 per person, this work demonstrates that prevention is not only effective but also scalable and cost-efficient.
In 2024, the EU was already GCERF’s largest donor. At the fund’s recent pledging conference in New York, held alongside the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the EU reaffirmed its commitment with a new pledge of EUR 10 million to expand these efforts further.
Scaling up proven approachesThis new support will help strengthen:
Restoring dignity, building resilienceDrawing on lessons from the Western Balkans, Iraq and elsewhere, GCERF has shown that successful reintegration reduces the risk of violence recurring while restoring dignity to individuals and communities.
By backing GCERF, the EU is investing in prevention as a vital complement to security and justice responses. This approach tackles local drivers of extremism before they escalate into violence with global repercussions."

Developed by Catalan manufacturer PROQUIMIA, the certified shampoo is a major step toward sustainable pet hygiene. Discover PROQUIMIA’s story and apply for the label to help ‘paw’ the way in sustainable pet care!","For the first time, an animal care product has been awarded the EU Ecolabel. The certified shampoo, developed by Catalan manufacturer PROQUIMIA, marks a significant step forward for sustainable innovation in pet hygiene. It also signals that environmental quality and animal well-being are increasingly viewed as part of the same equation.
Awarded in early 2025, the product meets the EU Ecolabel’s strict environmental and performance-related criteria. It is designed to minimise aquatic toxicity, use biodegradable ingredients, restrict hazardous substances and reduce packaging waste. In line with the EU Ecolabel criteria for animal care products, the product is not tested on animals.
The Flopp Pet Care shampoo will be available this autumn, giving pet owners a certified option that meets high standards for quality and environmental performance. In a market where consumers are presented with a wide range of “green” labels, the EU Ecolabel offers clear, independent proof that the product delivers on its promises.
This first certification sets a precedent. Animal care products had not previously been represented within the EU Ecolabel’s scope. The inclusion of this new product group reflects a growing awareness that sustainability must extend to the products we use for our pets. It also demonstrates that innovation in this space is both possible and commercially relevant.
PROQUIMIA, specialized in professional cleaning products and chemical solutions for industrial processes since 1971, brings longstanding experience with the EU Ecolabel. The company holds over 60 certified products across eight categories and continues to expand its portfolio.
“EU Ecolabel certification adds exceptional value, as it reinforces our commitment to developing innovative, high-performance products,” said Carles Bertrana, Technical Director.
Today, more than 20% of the company’s total sales come from EU Ecolabel-certified items - a clear indicator of both market trust and strategic relevance.
This first achievement sends a strong signal to the pet care industry.  The EU Ecolabel is open to more animal care products. Businesses ready to invest in less environmental impact solutions and long-term trust with consumers are encouraged to take the next step.

EMN inform examines international protection accommodation centres and local engagement,https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/emn-inform-examines-international-protection-accommodation-centres-and-local-engagement-2025-09-25_en,25 September 2025,"From international protection accommodation to community engagement, learn about the challenges and practices shared by EMN Member Countries and Serbia in the new EMN inform.","Managing distribution to support reception and integration
The inform analyses two distinct types of distribution: the distribution of international protection applicants and the distribution of accommodation centres. These are addressed separately in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the inform. Fourteen EMN Member Countries and Serbia distribute international protection applicants according to defined criteria, while 17 EMN Member Countries and Serbia distribute accommodation centres within their territory. Criteria include regional demographics, infrastructure, proximity to services, and individual needs assessments such as health conditions, family status, and vulnerability. Examples include the use of population-based distribution keys in France and tax-based allocation systems in Germany.
Some countries have introduced algorithmic matching tools to support more effective distribution and integration outcomes.
Community engagement varies across countries
Only five countries have formal communication plans to support the opening of new centres. Others rely on guidance or case-by-case outreach. Despite this, most responding countries engage with local authorities and elected representatives before or upon opening new accommodation centres. Sixteen also engage directly with local communities during this process.
In Belgium, for example, the national reception agency distributes flyers to local residents, holds information sessions with stakeholders, and appoints contact persons ahead of the centre’s opening. Outreach activities more broadly range from town hall meetings and newsletters to dedicated contact points and open house events. In Ireland, local outreach is structured around community integration forums, while the Netherlands has issued national guidelines to support municipal engagement and manage public information.
Local services and NGOs receive additional support in some countries
Seven reported mechanisms for allocating additional resources to local services, including funding for healthcare, education and public transport. Ireland, for instance, has introduced three dedicated funding streams to support NGOs and community groups. Croatia and the Slovak Republic channel support through projects funded by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF).
Challenges persist, but good practices are emerging
The inform highlights that most responding countries face challenges in engaging with local stakeholders, particularly in areas with limited prior experience of multicultural communities. Common issues include resistance from local residents and elected officials, lack of political will, and political tensions. A smaller number of countries reported delays in communication and complex coordination mechanisms. These challenges can affect not only the opening of accommodation centres but also their successful integration into local communities. The inform identifies a range of good practices grouped into five categories:
Supporting informed, inclusive policy development
This inform contributes to a growing body of EMN work examining the reception and integration of applicants for international protection. By offering a comparative overview of how accommodation centres are distributed and how relationships with local communities are managed, it provides a valuable resource for policymakers, local authorities, civil society organisations and other stakeholders seeking to promote balanced, inclusive and sustainable approaches to reception across Europe.

The meeting focused on the latest developments in this area and on how to reinforce judicial cooperation and improve prosecution for trafficking in human beings.
Prosecutors discussed trafficking in human beings for the purpose of organ removal, the role of AI in human trafficking, and challenges and best practices in cross-border investigations and judicial cooperation on cases of trafficking involving child victims.
The EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, Diane Schmitt stressed that the EU Anti-trafficking policy must be able to respond to the evolving geopolitical and threat landscape, in particular to the emerging forms of exploitation and the links with other crime areas and the challenges posed by new technologies. She added that it is of critical importance that all these new developments are taken into account in criminal judicial responses and that everything is done to prosecute and convict those behind this terrible crime. This also implies strong judicial and law enforcement cooperation.

Commissioner Jørgensen in Greenland to deepen cooperation with the EU,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/commissioner-jorgensen-greenland-deepen-cooperation-eu-2025-09-25_en,25 September 2025,Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen is in Greenland to reinforce the EU’s mutually beneficial partnership with the country.,"Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen is in Greenland to reinforce the EU’s mutually beneficial partnership with the country.
His visit follows the Commission’s proposal to double EU funding for Greenland under the next long-term budget (2028-2034).  Under the Commission’s next MFF proposal, Greenland will also be eligible for the proposed Competitiveness Fund, which will channel EU funds towards strategic technologies, including in the decarbonisation domain.
Yesterday, the Commissioner met with the Premier of Greenland, Jens Frederik Nielsen, and the Greenlandic Minister for Business, Raw Materials, Energy, Justice, and Gender Equality Naaja Nathanielsen on how the EU and Greenland can work together to harness the potential of clean energy sources and critical raw materials, and push forward the green transition while creating new economic opportunities for Greenland.
He also exchanged on energy cooperation with the CEO of NunaGreen, the company responsible for expansion of renewable energy in the country, and with Greenland’s national utility company Nukissiorfiit.
He visited the first and largest hydropower project of the country, the Buksefjorden hydroelectric power plant, for which support by the European Investment Bank is under discussion.
Yesterday, Commissioner Jørgensen also discussed EU-Greenland relations with the Head of the Nasiffik Centre for Foreign and Security Policy at the University of Greenland.
Today, he will continue discussions on strengthening cooperation on the green transition with representatives of the Ministry of Business, Raw Materials, Energy, Justice and Gender Equality, including Permanent Secretary Jørgen Hammecken Holm.
Commissioner Jørgensen said:
'The EU and Greenland have a shared interest in building a stronger partnership together: for our security, our independence and our competitiveness. I am glad to be here and exchange with the authorities and stakeholders to see how we can concretely move things forward. Clean energy, green growth, digitalisation and education are key areas for deeper cooperation. And by untapping the potential of critical raw materials and clean energy sources, we can drive the green transition in a mutually beneficial way for a sustainable economic growth in Greenland.'

Commission opens investigation into possible anticompetitive practices by SAP regarding maintenance and support services for its popular business management software,https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/about/news/commission-opens-investigation-possible-anticompetitive-practices-sap-regarding-maintenance-and-2025-09-25_en,25 September 2025,"The European Commission has opened a formal investigation to assess whether SAP may have distorted competition in the aftermarket for maintenance and support services related to an on-premises type of software, licensed by SAP, used for the management of companies' business operations","The European Commission has opened a formal investigation to assess whether SAP may have distorted competition in the aftermarket for maintenance and support services related to an on-premises type of software, licensed by SAP, used for the management of companies' business operations and called Enterprise Resource Planning (‘ERP'), in the European Economic Area (‘EEA'). In parallel to the opening of proceedings, the Commission has adopted a Preliminary Assessment summarising the main facts of the case and identifying its competition concerns. To address the Commission's concerns, SAP may now submit commitments.
SAP is a German-based multinational corporation which develops software applications for companies to manage their business operations. This includes ERP software, which supports business functions such as managing corporate finances, human resources and project management. SAP's ERP software can be provided on-premises - when the software runs on the customer's own servers - or via the cloud - when it is hosted on SAP's servers and delivered over the internet. SAP also provides maintenance and support services for its ERP software, which include regular updates and technical assistance for its business customers to keep the software operational. Other companies also provide maintenance and support services for SAP's on-premises ERP software, in competition with SAP, often against better commercial conditions, such as price.
The Commission's preliminary investigation takes issue with the following four practices implemented by SAP in the EEA aftermarket for the maintenance and support services of SAP's on-premises ERP software, on which the Commission preliminary considers that SAP holds a dominant position:
The Commission is concerned that SAP may have restricted competition from third-party providers of maintenance and support services of SAP's on-premises ERP software in the EEA. The Commission is also concerned that the practices implemented by SAP constitute exploitative conduct vis-à-vis SAP's customers that may be qualified as unfair trading conditions.
The Commission will now carry out its in-depth investigation as a matter of priority. The opening of a formal investigation does not prejudge its outcome.
Background
Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prohibits the abuse of a dominant position that may affect trade within the EU and prevent or restrict competition. The implementation of this provision is defined in Regulation 1/2003.
A Preliminary Assessment summarises the main facts of the case and identifies the competition concerns of the Commission. To meet these concerns, the addressee of the Preliminary Assessment may offer commitments in line with Article 9(1) of Regulation 1/2003, which allows the Commission to conclude antitrust proceedings by accepting commitments offered by a company. Such a decision does not reach a conclusion as to whether there is an infringement of EU antitrust rules, but legally binds the company to respect the commitments submitted.
Article 11(6) of Regulation 1/2003 provides that the opening of proceedings by the Commission relieves the competition authorities of the Member States of their competence to apply EU competition rules to the practices concerned. Article 16(1) further provides that national courts must avoid adopting decisions which would conflict with a decision contemplated by the Commission in proceedings it has initiated.
There is no legal deadline for bringing an antitrust investigation to an end. The duration of an antitrust investigation depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, the extent to which the companies concerned cooperate with the Commission and the parties' exercise of the rights of defense.
More information on the investigation will be available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under the case number AT.40823.
Thousands of companies across Europe use SAP’s software to run their business, as well as its related maintenance and support services. We are concerned that SAP may have restricted competition in this crucial aftermarket, by making it harder for rivals to compete, leaving European customers with fewer choices and higher costs. This is why we want to have a closer look at SAP’s potentially distortive business practices, to make sure that companies that rely on SAP’s software can freely choose the maintenance and support services that best fits their business needs.

EU and Ukraine extend road transport agreement until 31 March 2027,https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/eu-and-ukraine-extend-road-transport-agreement-until-31-march-2027-2025-09-25_en,25 September 2025,The EU and Ukraine decided today to extend the validity of their current road transport agreement.,"The EU and Ukraine decided today to extend the validity of their current road transport agreement until 31 March 2027.
Originally signed on 29 June 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Agreement facilitates Ukraine's access to global markets by enabling smoother transit through EU countries and strengthening trade links with the EU market. It has significantly boosted road trade between Ukraine and the EU, benefiting both economies.
By partly liberalising road freight transport through giving transit and bilateral transport rights to Ukrainian and EU hauliers for their respective territories, the agreement helps better anchoring the Ukrainian market into the EU. The agreement also continues to play a role in the context of the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes, facilitating the transport of vital goods like fuel and humanitarian aid, while enabling Ukrainian exports such as grain, ores, and steel to reach the EU and world markets.
Finally, the agreement still contributes to a significant reduction of the burden for the transport industry and authorities both in Ukraine and EU Member States, as it removed the need to issue permits for operations under the agreement.
As Ukraine advances on its European path and following requests by some Member States, it will also need to progressively align its road transport legislation with the EU road transport law. This will contribute to ensuring a level-playing field in the road transport sector.
Background
Eurostat data show that EU–Ukraine road trade has grown strongly since the Agreement entered into force. In 2024, EU road imports from Ukraine reached 7.7 million tonnes (+13% vs. 2021), worth EUR 10.1 billion (+12%). Road exports rose to 7.6 million tonnes (+11%), with value jumping by 48% to EUR 33.4 billion.
These trends are mirrored nationally, especially in neighbouring states. Poland’s road exports to Ukraine were 85% higher in 2024 than in 2021, Romania’s 124% higher, and Slovakia’s 106% higher. Imports also grew, though more moderately, leaving all three countries with significant positive trade balances (EUR 8.2 bn for Poland, EUR 677 m for Romania, EUR 803 m for Slovakia)."

The studies – a business implementation study for South Africa, and SAF feasibility studies for Ethiopia and India – represent an important step in advancing the global uptake of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).
Today’s event brought together European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Director-General for Mobility and Transport Magda Kopczyńska, ICAO Secretary-General Juan Carlos Salazar, and high-level representatives from South Africa, Ethiopia and India.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: ""These three completed studies show how international partnerships can turn ambition into action. Through ACT-SAF and in line with ICAO’s no country left behind strategic goal, we are ensuring that all states – regardless of size or geography – have the opportunity to develop sustainable aviation fuels, and contribute to global climate goals.""
This ACT-SAF project, with a total budget of €4 million financed by the EU, aims to help partner countries reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation through SAF development. Implemented jointly by ICAO and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the initiative covers 15 States across Africa and Asia, supporting feasibility studies, business cases and capacity-building activities."
How to shine during a group interview,https://eures.europa.eu/how-shine-during-group-interview-2025-09-25_en,25 September 2025,Have you been called in for an interview? Great news! But what if you discover that you will be attending… a group interview? We’ve got you covered.,"Group interviews are a somewhat obscure concept to job applicants. What is their purpose? How will you be assessed? And how are you expected to stand out among a number of other candidates attending the same interview as you? Some might consider these types of interviews the lazy employer’s way to save time by batching many candidates together. But this isn’t exactly the case.
Why a group interview?
Group interviews are a way for employers to screen multiple candidates at once and assess skills such as communication, teamwork, decision-making and leadership. They are more common for client-facing roles, for example in retail, hospitality and food service, where such competencies are front and centre. This format is seen as a simulation of what the role will actually involve, and candidates are assessed according to how they perform under ‘realistic’ conditions. Group interviews might be conducted to evaluate candidates for one role, or for many different roles.
What should I expect?
The interview might involve common interview questions, and it might also include group tasks, such as problem-solving exercises. Anticipate questions that are intended to test how present you are in a group setting. For example: ‘Who would you hire out of this group and why?’ or ‘What would you recommend this candidate improve on to increase their chances of being hired for this role?’ Remember that you will be assessed both on how you carry yourself within a group and on how you interact with and listen to others.
How, then, can I stand out?
Group interviews can be challenging and stressful. To help you navigate this tricky scenario and impress the interviewers, here are some tips on how to prepare and perform well in this interview format.
First of all, do your research on the company and the role you are applying for. This will help you present yourself confidently and show your interest and enthusiasm. It will also help you cope with the pressure of being in a group of strangers, as you will have some background knowledge and expectations of what the interview will entail.
Be original: don’t just repeat what others have said or give generic answers; instead, try to showcase your unique skills and experiences that are relevant to the role. You can also build on someone else’s answer by adding your own insights or examples. This way, you demonstrate your ability to listen, cooperate and contribute to the discussion.
Take the lead. One of the skills that employers look for in a group interview is leadership. If you have the chance to take the lead in a question, an opinion, a point or a task, don’t hesitate to do so. This shows that you are proactive, confident and capable of handling responsibility. However, be careful not to dominate the conversation or overshadow the others. You should also respect the opinions and inputs of your co-interviewees and give them space to express themselves.
Finally, be a team player. Employers want to see that you can work well with others, even if you don’t know them or agree with them. Engage with your co-interviewees, using their names, acknowledging their points and supporting their ideas. Treat them as your teammates, not as competitors. By being a team player, you show that you are collaborative, adaptable and respectful.

Rising trend of new childhood cancer cases in EU over time,https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/rising-trend-new-childhood-cancer-cases-eu-over-time-2025-09-25_en,25 September 2025,"The most common cancers among young children are leukaemias, central nervous system tumours and neuroblastomas.","The reported number of cancer cases in children and adolescents indicates a rising trend over time across the EU, according to new childhood cancer data published in the European Cancer Information System (ECIS).
In total, about 13,800 children and adolescents (6,200 girls and 7,600 boys) aged between 0 and 19 years old are estimated to have been diagnosed with cancer in 2022 for EU-27 countries, meaning that 1 in 326 children were diagnosed with the disease before their 20th birthday.
Sadly, over 2,100 children and adolescents (900 girls and 1,200 boys) were estimated to lose their lives due to cancer in 2022, resonating as a reminder that despite vast improvements in cancer survival rates in children and adolescents in Europe, much work still needs to be done to overcome this situation.
Although improved diagnostic techniques and cancer registration quality may contribute to the rising trend, researchers suggest that these factors cannot fully explain the observed rise, indicating a real increase in the number of cases. Certain infections and genetic traits can predispose a child to developing cancer, but, in contrast to cancer causes in adults, other risk factors for childhood cancers are poorly understood.
The types of cancers affecting children and adolescents vary with age. The most common cancers among young children (0–4 years old) are leukaemias, central nervous system tumours and neuroblastomas. In contrast, teenagers aged between 15 and 19 years old are more likely to develop lymphomas, central nervous system tumours, and other malignant epithelial tumours and melanomas.
This is quite different to the most common types of cancer affecting adults, such as breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers.
Incidence rates also vary with age. The highest overall cancer incidence is seen in the youngest children and in older children and adolescents.
Some cancers, like leukaemia, decrease with age while most other cancers, for example lymphomas, become more common.
Childhood cancer, while relatively rare compared with adult cancers, is a major public health priority in Europe due to its profound lifelong impact on survivors and their families.
Policy attention has grown significantly under Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan (2021), which identifies childhood cancer as an area requiring dedicated action, including the creation of the EU Network of Youth Cancer Survivors and targeted research investment through the EU Cancer Mission.
Between 2021-2024, around 20% of the EUR 490 million EU Cancer Mission budget powered cutting-edge research in youth cancer, across the entire cancer continuum.
Complementing this, the European Reference Network for Paediatric Oncology works to improve access to high-quality healthcare for children and adolescents with cancer.
At the same time, the European Health Data Space and the European Cancer Inequalities Registry highlight the critical role of high-quality, standardised data to monitor trends and inequalities in cancer prevention, care and outcomes, including access to timely diagnosis and treatment, and survivorship care across Member States.
The updated European ‘childhood incidence data’ section of the European Cancer Information System brings data together from across Europe. This allows policymakers and stakeholders in Member States to evaluate trends, geographic variations and outcomes for different diagnostic groups of childhood cancer."
Commission launches second call for strategic projects to secure critical raw materials supply,https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-launches-second-call-strategic-projects-secure-critical-raw-materials-supply-2025-09-25_en,25 September 2025,"Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy, Stéphane Séjourné today announced the launch of the second call for strategic projects to ensure a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials for European industry.","Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy, Stéphane Séjourné today announced the launch of the second call for strategic projects to ensure a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials for European industry.
The announcement was made from Kiruna, Sweden, and builds on the success of the first call, which selected 60 strategic projects.
The cut-off date for submissions is 15 January 2026, 12:00 (noon) CET. A dedicated online information session for interested promoters will be held on 9 October. Additional information is available on the strategic projects under the Critical Raw Materials Act website.
These strategic projects advance the implementation of the Critical Raw Materials Act, strengthening the EU's resilience by securing raw materials that are key for the green and digital transitions. They boost domestic production, diversify supply, and deepen mutually beneficial partnerships. To qualify, projects must meaningfully enhance supply security, be technically feasible, and ensure sustainable implementation. Selected projects benefit from faster permitting, as well as facilitated access to finance and offtakes. The Commission works closely with Member States and financial institutions to make these benefits a reality.
Executive Vice-President Séjourné said: ""With our first wave of strategic projects, the EU has shown the potential of boosting domestic extraction, refining, processing, and recycling within the EU, and of cooperating with partner countries, to reduce dependencies, strengthen economic security, and diversify supply. It is another key step towards European sovereignty. I now invite project promoters to submit more projects for all 17 strategic raw materials."""

Better protection of surface and groundwater to strengthen EU water resilience,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2197,24 September 2025,The Commission has welcomed a provisional political agreement reached between the Council and Parliament on a proposal to update the lists of water pollutants.,"The Commission welcomes the provisional political agreement reached yesterday between the European Parliament and the Council on the Commission proposal to update the lists of water pollutants. This revision ensures that the lists of water pollutants will be aligned with the latest scientific advice and that new substances will be monitored and more strictly controlled in surface waters and groundwater. Three pieces of EU legislation will be adapted accordingly: the Water Framework Directive, the Environmental Quality Standard Directive and the Groundwater Directive. The new measures will make the EU more water resilient and mark an important contribution towards its zero-pollution ambition.
New substances added to lists of water pollutants
New substances with well-documented harmful effects on the environment and human health will be added to the lists of water pollutants. These include:
In addition, the agreement updates the limits for pollutants already included in the lists. Furthermore, six substances no longer posing an EU-wide risk are moved to the lists of pollutants of national concern thanks to action taken to ban or restrict their use, in line with the latest scientific evidence.
New simplification measures
In the spirit of simplification, the agreement introduces certain short-term exemptions to the principle of non-deterioration of water quality and quantity. Member States will be able to apply a simplified procedure under certain conditions as long as pollution does not increase, and thus compromise environmental or health protection.
The agreement also reduces administrative burden for Member States by streamlining reporting requirements and making it easier to share monitoring data between Member States and the Commission through digital tools. The new rules also strengthen transboundary cooperation, ensuring mandatory downstream river basin warnings after incidents.
Next steps
The European Parliament and the Council will now have to formally adopt the new Directive, which will enter into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the EU.
Member States will then need to implement its requirements and transpose the amendments to the three relevant Directives: Water Framework Directive, the Environmental Quality Standard Directive and the Groundwater Directive, by 22 December 2027.
Background
The Commission adopted its proposal for a revised lists of pollutants in surface and groundwater on 26 October 2022. The Directive is a key element of the European Green Deal and the Zero Pollution Action Plan.
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) focuses on protecting and sustainably managing water resources. It requires Member States to use their River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) and Programmes of Measures (PoMs) to protect and, where necessary, restore water bodies in order to reach good status, and to prevent deterioration. Good status means both good chemical and good ecological status.
The WFD is the primary legislation and is supported by two so-called daughter directives on the quality and quantity of groundwater – the Groundwater Directive (GWD) – and on the quality of surface water – the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (EQSD). This list of priority substances needs to be reviewed, and updated if necessary, every six years.

Today’s agreement is an important step to achieve cleaner water for all Europeans. We are taking a big step forward to restrict pollution in water from PFAS, pesticides and other hazardous chemicals. This is in line with the ambition set out in the European Water Resilience Strategy to make Europe more water resilient. Clean water is good for people, good for the environment and good for our economy: an investment that will pay us back many times.

The Road to Green 20: How do we combine urban development and quality of life?,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/video-how-do-we-combine-urban-development-quality-life-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,"In this latest 'The Road to Green' episode, Euronews explores how European cities are innovating with solutions to tackle environmental challenges.","Euronews is in Lisbon and Lahti this time round to see how they are pioneering solutions to combat climate challenges and enhance urban living, while taking citizens and businesses on board.
Since two-thirds of Europeans reside in urban areas, there is a pressing need to enhance air quality and make cities more resilient to the impacts of climate change. This episode shows how nature-based and circular solutions can do just that.
Lisbon, a vibrant southern city, is addressing the growing threat of heatwaves and rainstorms by transforming its urban landscape. The city plans to plant 240,000 trees and develop sponge city initiatives to boost biodiversity, manage stormwater effectively, and reduce the risk of flooding and rising temperatures.
Meanwhile, in Finland, Lahti is setting the standard for sustainability by turning its once most polluted lake into a symbol of environmental recovery.
Aiming for carbon neutrality by 2028 and reducing emissions by 80% across transport, energy and industry, Lahti is embracing a circular economy approach. Local businesses are key players in this transformation, collaborating to cut waste and adopt renewable energy sources.
These efforts show the important role that cities like Lisbon and Lahti play in building resilience and improving urban living conditions. Sustainable progress and economic growth can go hand in hand, promising long-term benefits for both citizens and the environment.

With two-thirds of Europeans living in cities, the EU is taking action to improve urban quality of life by tackling pollution, climate impacts, and biodiversity loss. Targets include cutting premature deaths from air pollution by 55% by 2030 and reducing harmful noise, which affects 1 in 5 people.
Under the Nature Restoration Regulation, cities must prevent the loss of green space and tree cover by 2030, with increases required thereafter.
The EU is also strengthening urban water management through its Water Resilience Strategy, aiming to safeguard access to clean water and reduce the impact of droughts and floods.
The Green City Accord supports cities in delivering environmental improvements, offering guidance, visibility, and access to EU funding. Urban leadership is also recognised through the European Green Capital and Green Leaf awards, promoting local innovation for greener, healthier cities."
EU provides additional €50 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Palestine,https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/news-stories/news/eu-provides-additional-eu50-million-emergency-humanitarian-aid-palestine-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,The EU's additional funding will help its humanitarian partners on the ground deliver life-saving assistance both in Gaza and the West Bank.,"The European Commission has released an additional €50 million* in humanitarian assistance to respond to the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and to address the rising humanitarian needs in the West Bank. This brings total EU emergency humanitarian aid in 2025 to €220 million to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to over €550 million since 2023.
The first ever famine has been confirmed in Gaza and the massive, forced displacement caused by the ongoing Gaza City military offensive is leaving families desperate for food, shelter, healthcare, and protection. In the occupied West Bank continued forced displacement, severe movement restrictions, and settler violence lead to acute humanitarian needs in protection, shelter, and access to basic services.
The EU's additional funding will help its humanitarian partners on the ground deliver life-saving assistance both in Gaza and the West Bank. Safe, unimpeded access for humanitarian workers is vital across Gaza, and civilians must be protected wherever they are.
Since October 2023, the EU has also organised 77 Humanitarian Airbridge flights and has shipped 5,037 tonnes of relief supplies, including medicines, medical supplies, shelter, water and sanitation, and educational items on behalf of humanitarian partners, EU Member States and from the EU's own stocks. Since 2024, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, has also coordinated the medical evacuations of 306 patients throughout Europe.
Commissioner for Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, said:
‘Famine is now a reality in Gaza and the humanitarian situation is intolerable. The European Union is stepping up its response with an additional €50 million in emergency aid. But funding alone is not enough: civilians must be protected, humanitarian access must be guaranteed and international humanitarian law must be respected by all parties. The EU will continue to work with its partners to press for these obligations to be met and for a political solution that ends the suffering.’
In Gaza, over 1.9 million people (over 90% of the population) have been repeatedly forcibly displaced amid intensified Israeli bombardments, including in tents, hospitals and schools, ongoing ground confrontations, and recurrent forced displacement orders.
As of 22 August 2025, Famine (IPC Phase 5) has been confirmed in Gaza Governorate and projected to expand to Deir al- Balah and Khan Younis Governorates in late September. After months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions, characterised by starvation, destitution and death. Another 1.07 million people, 54 percent of the population, are facing an Emergency or Crisis situation.
In the West Bank, the humanitarian situation continues to significantly worsen, due to, inter alia, rapid settlement expansion and legalisation heightening the risk of de facto annexation, Israeli military operations, and persistent Israeli settler attacks on Palestinian communities with at least 2,300 settler attacks in the West Bank.
Almost 40,000 people have been displaced since 1 January 2024.

This brings total EU humanitarian support for Yemen to €120 million in 2025, and to almost €1 billion since 2015.","The European Commission is releasing an additional €40 million in humanitarian aid to confront Yemen’s rapidly worsening crisis and help stave off famine. This brings total EU humanitarian support for Yemen to €120 million in 2025, and to almost €1 billion since 2015.
Years of war, economic collapse, and climate shocks have left more than half of the population facing acute food insecurity.  More than 19.5 million people need humanitarian assistance and 17.1 million face crisis levels of food insecurity. Nearly 2 million children are malnourished, including half a million in severe condition. The health system is close to breakdown, with disease outbreaks spreading as facilities shut for lack of funds.
EU funding will provide urgent food, nutrition and health assistance, prioritising districts at highest risk of famine. As an additional layer of assistance, a recent EU Humanitarian Air Bridge operation delivered over 432 tonnes of medicines and life-saving supplies. Thanks to close cooperation with 11 humanitarian partners, this aid reached families across the country.
The EU is the largest donor to the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan and remains a key partner in the UN-led efforts to uphold international humanitarian law and regional stability.
Commissioner for Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, said:
‘Behind the bleak humanitarian data there are millions of people in Yemen whose lives are in danger. Families cannot feed their children, hospitals are closing their doors, and preventable diseases are spreading. The EU is stepping up its support to bring food, treatment, and care to those most in need. Humanitarian aid must never be instrumentalised, blocked or retained.’
The EU’s latest allocation of €40 million is drawn from its emergency funding reserves, adding to another €80 million already allocated this year.
A significant portion of the EU’s humanitarian assistance is supported through cash transfers to aid recipients, widely recognised as the most efficient, effective and dignified method of humanitarian assistance.

The agreement guarantees a high level of protection of fundamental rights, including through strong data protection safeguards.","Commissioner for Home Affairs and Migration, Magnus Brunner and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility of Ecuador, Gabriela Sommerfeld signed an agreement on the exchange of data between Europol and Ecuador to help fight organised crime and terrorism.
This agreement builds on an existing working arrangement, under which Europol and Ecuadorian authorities cooperated to seize 80 tons of drugs and 36 arrests in March 2025. The new agreement enables Europol and Ecuador to improve the exchange of information, including personal data. The agreement guarantees a high level of protection of fundamental rights, including through strong data protection safeguards.
It is now for the European Parliament to give its consent for the conclusion of the agreement.
Stepping up information exchange with partner countries is a key element of the EU’s efforts to boost international cooperation on security. This was also highlighted in the new European Internal Security Strategy - ProtectEU presented in April 2025. The EU already has a similar agreement in place with New Zealand. Another such agreement was signed with Brazil in March 2025."
Commission launches information campaign to inform travellers about the Entry/Exit System,https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-launches-information-campaign-inform-travellers-about-entryexit-system-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,"The Entry/Exit System (EES) is set to enter into operation on 12 October 2025, modernising the border check procedures for non-EU nationals travelling for short stays to Europe.

The European Commission launched an information campaign to ensure a smooth transition to the EES changes and to inform millions of visitors subject to the EES registration. The campaign was prepared in cooperation with the European Data Protection Supervisor, national supervisory authorities and member states experts.
The EES is an advanced IT system that will digitally record the entries and exits of non-EU nationals travelling to 29 European countries, for short stays. It will register biometric data such as fingerprints, facial images, and passport data.
The EES will modernise and improve the management of external borders. By accurately tracking data, it will help prevent irregular immigration, identify overstayers, and reduce identity fraud. Internal security will be enhanced through real-time access to reliable information, enabling relevant national authorities to swiftly identify individuals posing a security threat.
From 12 October onwards, European countries using the EES will start introducing the EES gradually over a period of six months. Border authorities will progressively register the data of third country nationals crossing the external Schengen borders. At the end of the progressive period, the EES will be fully deployed at all border crossing points.
The campaign will run in parallel with the launch of the EES and continue for about a year. A wide range of materials has been produced to support it: printed information that can be displayed at border crossing points, dedicated leaflets for travellers and for carriers, and digital materials such as visuals, videos and social media content. By being available in all EU official languages and several widely spoken non-EU languages, the information will be accessible to as many travellers as possible, both inside and outside the EU.
The EES official website brings together all relevant information for travellers: how the system works, who it applies to, and what to expect at border controls. It also includes frequently asked questions, information on data protection and travellers’ rights, and access to communication materials in multiple languages. The website is regularly updated.
Reaching travellers worldwide requires joint effort. Member States, carriers, travel and tourism agencies, EU Delegations in third countries and other partners are invited to share the campaign materials across their networks, whether at consulates, airports, ferry terminals, train stations, travel hubs or online.

New EU rules on REMIT fees,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/new-eu-rules-remit-fees-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,"The Commission revised the rules on financing of the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), warranting greater fairness and transparency.","The European Commission revised the rules on financing of the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), warranting greater fairness and transparency. The new framework, set out in Commission Decision (EU) 2025/1771, has been applying since 15 September 2025.
Under the revised Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT), ACER is entitled to collect fees from REMIT data reporting entities to cover a part of its operations (‘REMIT fees’). The new decision strengthens the long-term sustainability of ACER’s monitoring activities. It ensures that ACER has the resources needed to monitor the 47% annual increase in data reporting observed since 2021. In addition, the new fee system reflects ACER’s expanded supervisory and investigatory powers under the revised REMIT, including dealing with cross-border market abuse. This will strengthen the oversight of Europe’s energy markets at a time when transparency, consumer confidence and ensuring open and fair competition in the electricity and gas markets are more important than ever.
The updated fee system ensures that the costs of ACER’s monitoring activities under REMIT are shared fairly among reporting entities, based on the number of transaction records coming from the market participants on whose behalf they report to ACER, while at the same time preventing undue financial burden. Fees are calculated in a way that balances fixed annual contributions with variable fees linked to the level of market activity. This ensures that, when reporting entities further pass the costs on their clients, larger or market participants with higher volumes of transactions contribute more, while smaller market participants face proportionate obligations.
REMIT establishes EU-wide rules designed to protect the functioning of the EU’s wholesale energy markets. It prohibits insider trading and market manipulation, making sure that prices reflect genuine supply and demand and therefore safeguarding consumers and businesses from unfair practices.
ACER plays a central role in monitoring the trading activities of market participants in the energy markets and collecting data on transactions across the EU. To carry out these tasks, ACER needs sustainable funding. The fee system in the new decision ensures that those who benefit from participating in EU energy markets by providing reporting services to energy companies and system operators, contribute to the costs of monitoring."

From OLAF’s investigation to EPPO conviction: Joint Efforts Deliver Results in Croatia,https://anti-fraud.ec.europa.eu/media-corner/news/olafs-investigation-eppo-conviction-joint-efforts-deliver-results-croatia-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,One of the European Anti-Fraud Office’s first complementary investigations conducted in close cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office has resulted in a second conviction.,"PRESS RELEASE No 24/2025PDF version
One of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)’s first complementary investigations conducted in close cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) has resulted in a second conviction. The case, closed by OLAF in 2022, concerned the award of a contract for a “strategic management” information system in Croatia, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund.
The complementary investigation of OLAF focused on a public procurement procedure awarded in 2018. Allegations of favouritism and tender manipulations by the public authority prompted OLAF to open an administrative investigation.
During its investigation, OLAF reported the case to the EPPO which opened its own criminal investigation. OLAF, in cooperation with EPPO, then carried out simultaneous on-the-spot checks combined with digital forensic operations at the headquarters of the lead consortium partner as well as at the public authority which was the beneficiary of EU funds. Furthermore, both Offices shared the results of their preliminary analysis of the material collected.
OLAF’s findings uncovered potential collusion between the public authority and the economic operator to both inflate the value of the public procurement procedure and ensure that the contract was awarded to the pre-chosen economic operator. Notably, at the time of the contract award, the lead partner of the consortium had only minimal capacity to deliver such a project.
Following their joint efforts, OLAF recommended the recovery of 1.4 million EUR to the European Commission while the EPPO indicted several high-ranking officials in Croatia. You can read more about the latest development in EPPO’s press release here.
The acting Director-General Salla Saastamoinen praises the landmark case: “This case is a milestone in cooperation between OLAF and the EPPO. By combining our strengths – OLAF’s administrative expertise and EPPO’s judicial powers – we ensured that EU taxpayer’s money was recovered and that those responsible are being brought to justice. Our joint action in Croatia shows that the EU protects its financial interests with determination and that the institutional cooperation brings strong added value.”
OLAF mission, mandate and competences:OLAF’s mission is to detect, investigate and stop fraud with EU funds.
OLAF fulfils its mission by:•    carrying out independent investigations into fraud and corruption involving EU funds, so as to ensure that all EU taxpayers’ money reaches projects that can create jobs and growth in Europe;•    contributing to strengthening citizens’ trust in the EU Institutions by investigating serious misconduct by EU staff and members of the EU Institutions;•    developing a sound EU anti-fraud policy.
In its independent investigative function, OLAF can investigate matters relating to fraud, corruption and other offences affecting the EU financial interests concerning:•    all EU expenditure: the main spending categories are Structural Funds, agricultural policy and rural development funds, direct expenditure and external aid;•    some areas of EU revenue, mainly customs duties;•    suspicions of serious misconduct by EU staff and members of the EU institutions.
Once OLAF has completed its investigation, it is for the competent EU and national authorities to examine and decide on the follow-up of OLAF’s recommendations. All persons concerned are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a competent national or EU court of law.

The plan focuses on four main goals:
The European Union supported Libya in developing the plan through its CBRN Centres of Excellence (CoE) initiative. Funded by the EU, the initiative provides technical assistance and promotes cooperation between countries to reduce CBRN risks.
By helping partners strengthen their own safety and security systems, the CoE initiative contributes to peace, stability and conflict prevention around the world.

EU agri-food trade remains robust despite increasing prices,https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/media/news/eu-agri-food-trade-remains-robust-despite-increasing-prices-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,"EU agri-food trade remained strong in June 2025. Exports held steady above 2024 levels, while imports increased due to high commodity prices. Cocoa, coffee and chocolate drove export growth, but cereals declined. The trade surplus rebounded in June, yet stayed one-third below last year overall.","EU agri-food exports stayed stable in June, with a slight decline compared to May but still above 2024 levels. Imports fell compared to May yet remained higher year-on-year. The overall trade surplus rebounded, though it remains below last year, due to higher import prices.
EU agri-food exports reached €19.1 billion in June, a decline of 4% from May but still 2% higher than in June 2024. In the first half of 2025, cumulative exports totalled €118.7 billion, an increase of €2.6 billion (+2%) compared to the same period in 2024.
The UK was the leading destination, accounting for €27.6 billion (+€1.2 billion, +5%), supported by high cocoa and chocolate prices. It was followed by the US and Switzerland.
By contrast, exports to China fell by €670 million (−10%) on the back of reduced cereals demand, while exports to Thailand declined by €242 million, partly for the same reason.
Cocoa and coffee products continued to underpin growth. Exports of coffee, tea, cocoa and spices rose by €1.8 billion (+38%), reflecting a near-doubling of cocoa paste, butter and powder prices alongside a 30% rise in coffee prices. Chocolate and confectionery exports climbed by €1 billion (+20%), while dairy exports added €635 million (+7%), despite lower volumes.
Meanwhile, cereals exports declined by €1.5 billion in the first half of the year (−22%), due to a 27% fall in volumes, while olive and olive oil exports declined by €572 million (−15%) as falling prices outweighed higher volumes. Non-edible goods exports also decreased (−12%), largely due to lower plant fibre prices.
EU agri-food imports stood at €15.3 billion in June, down 10% compared to May but still 15% higher than in June of last year. Between January and June, cumulative imports reached €96.8 billion, an increase of €13.5 billion (+16%) compared to the same period last year.
During this period, Côte d’Ivoire recorded the largest increase (+€2 billion, +66%), reflecting high cocoa prices. Canada followed (+€1.2 billion, +101%) due increased imports of cereals and rapeseed. Imports from China grew by €946 million (+22%), and Brazil by €838 million (+10%). By contrast, imports from Ukraine fell by €891 million (−13%) while those from Russia dropped by €566 million (−73%).
High commodity prices drove much of the increase. Imports of coffee, tea, cocoa and spices rose by €8.1 billion (+60%), fruit and nuts by €2.3 billion (+18%), and confectionery and chocolate by €433 million (+36%). Non-edible goods increased by €492 million (+10%), while poultry and eggs rose by €356 million (+30%). In contrast, olives and olive oil fell by €466 million (−43%), and sugar and isoglucose by €332 million (−32%).
The EU agri-food trade surplus reached €3.8 billion in June, a bounce of 32% compared to May. However, at €21.9 billion for the first half of 2025, the surplus remains €10.9 billion lower (−33%) than in the same period of 2024, reflecting rising import costs."
Solidarity Lanes: Latest figures – August 2025,https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/solidarity-lanes-latest-figures-august-2025-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,Latest figures on Ukrainian exports and imports via the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes: new transport routes established in the face of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.,"In the face of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU, together with Ukraine and Moldova launched the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes in May 2022, establishing new transport routes to keep Ukraine’s imports and exports flowing via rail, road and inland waterways. Today, the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes have become a lifeline for Ukraine’s economy.
In August 2025, Solidarity Lanes transported:
Since May 2022, the Solidarity Lanes have allowed Ukraine to export nearly 196 million tonnes (Mt) of goods, according to data from the Ukrainian customs registers. Within this amount, it can be estimated that the Solidarity Lanes enabled exports of more than 95 million tonnes of Ukrainian agricultural products (including nearly 88 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain, oilseeds and related products) and around 101 million tonnes of non-agricultural goods including ores, steel and related products.
In total, around 207 Mt of Ukrainian grain, oilseeds and related products were exported through the Solidarity Lanes (40%) and the Ukrainian Black Sea ports (60%) since May 2022 [1].
The Solidarity Lanes also play a crucial role for Ukrainian imports. Since May 2022, they have allowed Ukraine to import ca. 86 Mt of goods, such as fuel, vehicles, fertilisers as well as military and humanitarian assistance.
The total value of trade via the Solidarity Lanes since May 2022 is estimated at around EUR 236 billion, with around EUR 66 billion for Ukrainian exports. The total value of imports to Ukraine is estimated at ca. EUR 170 billion.
Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the blockade of Ukrainian seaports, Ukraine has been unable to export its produce and import what it needs via its usual transport routes.
Against this background, the EU established 'Solidarity Lanes' to ensure Ukraine can export grain, iron ore, steel and other products and to import the goods it needs, from fuel to military and humanitarian assistance, via alternative transport routes: inland waterways, rail and road. The Solidarity Lanes cover trade across all sectors and are an unprecedented cooperation of authorities and businesses in EU Member States, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova.
The Solidarity Lanes’ work is carried out in close cooperation between the European Commission, concerned authorities and the transport community. The focus is on addressing bottlenecks to enhance the capacity and smooth functioning of the Solidarity Lanes to sustain Ukrainian exports and imports across sectors. This includes measures to improve traffic management and streamlining of border procedures and checks, as well as investments in infrastructure or logistics equipment.
The Solidarity Lanes are also laying the ground for the longer-term connectivity between Ukraine and the EU and will play a key role for Ukraine’s reconstruction and integration in the EU single market.
[1] Between May and July 2022, the Solidarity Lanes were the only option for Ukraine to export its agricultural produce. In August 2022, the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) helped relaunch grain shipments from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. In mid-July 2023, Russia terminated its participation in the BSGI, which was consequently discontinued.
In August 2023, Ukraine launched a new Black Sea corridor for trade vessels heading to and from Ukrainian sea ports despite Russia’s withdrawal from the BSGI. The role of this corridor has increased over time, with 3.3 Mt of grain, oilseeds and other related products exported this way in July 2025."

A key deliverable of the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy, the European Innovation Act will take the form of a legislative act, aiming to remove barriers that hamper the commercialisation and diffusion of innovations.
The consultations touch upon challenges in commercialising research results, in industry–academia collaboration, in accessing markets (including the private and the public procurement market) and in accessing finance, talent and research and technology infrastructures. They also address other issues, such as how Europe could benefit from wider use of regulatory sandboxes, an innovation stress test to make legislation more innovation-friendly, reduced administrative and regulatory burden, and from raising and better coordinating overall innovation investments across Europe.
Meanwhile, Member States and Associated Countries were invited to share their expertise on regulatory sandboxes and definitions of startups, scaleups and innovative companies in the meeting of the European Innovation Council Forum  that took place on 15 September 2025. The participants had the opportunity to learn more about the future EU Startups and Scaleups Scoreboard that will measure the implementation and impact of the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy.

Commission finds fraud and potential safety issues in cinnamon on the EU market,https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/commission-finds-fraud-and-potential-safety-issues-cinnamon-eu-market-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,A new JRC study reveals cases of fraud and non-compliance with the food safety legislation in cinnamon sold at EU retailers.,"As part of the European Commission efforts to fight fraud in the herbs and spices sector, JRC scientists used four in-house developed innovative screening methods to detect and identify possible fraudulent practices.
They went beyond identifying the substitution of Ceylon cinnamon the most valuable variety, with cassia, a cheaper and less aromatic alternative, and identified other likely types of substitution, investigated compliance with existing European legislation and international standards. The analysis involved  104 cinnamon samples – 44 of which were labelled as Ceylon cinnamon – purchased at retailers in 10 EU countries, and in the UK, Serbia and Sri Lanka.
Over 66 % of the samples analysed failed to meet international quality standards, were non-compliant with EU food safety legislation, suspected of fraud, and/or potentially exceeded the legal coumarin limits. Coumarin is a natural aromatic compound found in cassia and other plants, potentially toxic for liver.
The results of the investigation can help the scientific community and policy makers to set threshold values for the different cinnamon components, and to define when to consider a sample as suspicious. This will allow to undertake a more detailed surveillance and help competent authorities take action.
In 2023, cinnamon was the fifth most imported spice in the EU following ginger, paprika, pepper and turmeric; with cinnamon demand expected to grow over the next years, cinnamon is an attractive target for fraudsters.
There are two main botanical types of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum or Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume), native to Sri Lanka, and Cassia (Cinnamomum cassia or Cinnamomum aromaticum), native to Myanmar, a cheaper and lower quality alternative with stronger taste, which naturally contains coumarin. Depending on the marketplace, both types may often be labelled simply as “cinnamon” which can lead to confusion.
The JRC conducted a holistic study applying several methods of analysis to detect different types of fraud in the sector. As much as 9% of the samples labelled as Ceylon cinnamon, were totally or partially substituted by Cassia cinnamon.
Other types of fraud, such as substitution of bark by other parts of the cinnamon tree such as roots, leaves, and flowers, were suspected in a high rate of samples. Moreover, around 21 % of the samples failed to meet international standards due to a high total ash content.
The study also showed that 9.6 % of the samples did not comply with the maximum limit of 2 mg kg-1, set for lead by the European food safety legislation and that 31 of the analysed samples were potentially hazardous for children due to a high coumarin content.
The type of irregularities detected in cinnamon, including fraudulent practises, is diverse and cannot be addressed with only one analytical technique, and standardised methods are needed. The high rate of irregular cinnamon samples in the European market indicates that attention should be paid to the situation by all stakeholders in the sector, policy makers, control laboratories, and manufacturers alike.
The study proposes analytical techniques that can be used as screening and confirmatory methods which could be adopted by official control laboratories to detect fraudulent samples with higher accuracy.
Cinnamon marketed in the EU must comply with several regulations, on:
In addition, the regulation on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods sets maximum levels of coumarin ranging from 5 mg kg−1 in desserts to 50 mg kg−1 in traditional and/or seasonal bakery products labelled as containing cinnamon. There isn’t a specific provision which applies to coumarin naturally present in cinnamon.

Commission seeks views on future of European Standardisation,https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-seeks-views-future-european-standardisation-2025-09-24_en,24 September 2025,The Commission has launched a public consultation seeking views from the public and experts on the upcoming revision of EU Standardisation Regulation.,"The European Commission has launched a public consultation on the upcoming revision of the EU standardisation regulation. This consultation will help shape future policy measures aimed at strengthening the European standardisation system and safeguarding Europe's leadership in developing high-quality, trusted standards. By ensuring that standards are efficient and effective, the EU can advance its green and digital ambitions while reinforcing its position as a leading global standard-setter.
The revision was announced in the competitiveness compass in January 2025. Standard-setting delays have been highlighted among the key barriers identified in the single market strategy. The revision will play an important role in addressing this challenge and enhancing the effectiveness of the single market. It will also boost the EU's competitiveness by fostering innovation, enabling access to new technologies, and reinforcing the EU's influence in international standardisation.
Planned for adoption in 2026, the revised regulation will make the standard-setting process faster, more responsive to policy needs, and more inclusive, especially for SMEs and startups. The Commission outlined the main priorities for the revision in its evaluation published in July 2025. Stakeholders and experts are invited to contribute through the online consultation available on the Commission's 'Have Your Say' portal by 17 December 2025."

Proposed by the Commission in February 2025, the package strengthens InvestEU, the EU's flagship investment instrument, by increasing the EU guarantee by €2.9 billion – unlocking nearly €55 billion in additional public and private investments, and allocating additional €40 million to the InvestEU Advisory Hub. Almost 40% of InvestEU operations already contribute to climate action, and the enhanced guarantee will further support projects under the Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal. The reform will also provide more efficient procedures for applicants and businesses, cutting red tape so they can focus on growing and creating quality jobs across Europe.
The agreement will boost EU investment capacity by reinvesting returns from past operations, make it easier for Member States to channel additional resources into InvestEU, provide extra support through the InvestEU Advisory Hub to help develop quality investment projects, and reduce administrative burden, with simplified reporting expected to save up to €350 million in costs. With these changes, InvestEU will mobilise fresh investment, driving competitiveness, research, innovation, decarbonisation, sustainability and skills. By leveraging both private and public funds, InvestEU is a cornerstone of the EU's long-term strategy for growth. It underpins Europe's twin transitions – green and digital – while reinforcing economic resilience and opportunities for businesses and citizens alike."
Seven facts to help understand migration,https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/seven-facts-help-understand-migration-2025-09-23_en,23 September 2025,"Public debate about migration is often driven by sensationalist news and emotional, polarising statements. It can be difficult to keep track and distinguish between opinions, facts and willful manipulation. The following facts could contribute to a more balanced debate on migration.","Public debate about migration is often driven by sensationalist news and emotional, polarising statements. It can be difficult to keep track and distinguish between opinions, facts and willful manipulation. The following facts could contribute to a more balanced debate on migration and EU migration policy.
Europeans tend to think that there are more migrants in their society than there are in reality. According to the most recent Eurobarometer on integration of migrants (2022), 68% of respondents overestimated the real share of migrants in the population. The figure varies between EU Member States but on average, Europeans believe that 16% of their country's population are non-EU citizens, while the actual share is less than 7%.
For context, more than 93% of people living in the EU are EU citizens. Latest Eurostat data shows that in 2024, 29 million people living in the EU were non-EU citizens, representing 6.4% of total EU population (Poland and Sweden don’t count refugees from Ukraine in these statistics). The number grew from 21 million (5%) in 2019.
The EU is working to control external borders and limit irregular migration. In 2024, Frontex reported 239 000 irregular border crossings, 25% less than in 2023. The numbers continued to drop on all the monitored routes also in the first 7 months of 2025.
The Commission works closely with EU countries and agencies, international partners and non-governmental organisations to prevent irregular migration and ensure the dignified return of those who are not eligible to stay in the EU. An important driver of reduced irregular border crossings is a more targeted effort by EU and national authorities to dismantle migrant smuggling networks. Agreements and partnerships between the EU and African countries such as Tunisia, Egypt or Mauritania have also helped to limit irregular departures from these countries.
The EU has clear and transparent rules allowing people to enter and reside on its territory. Most people entering the EU come through legal migration channels, such as work, study, family reunification, or resettlement. These legal pathways mainly help address EU labour market needs. Based on the latest data in 2023, more than 3.9 million non-EU citizens obtained the right to both reside and work in the EU. Nearly 90 000 highly qualified non-EU workers received an EU Blue Card. These numbers are significantly higher than the number of irregular border crossings (around 380 000 in 2023 and 239 000 in 2024).
The EU lacks workers. According to the recent report by Mario Draghi, around a quarter of European companies have faced difficulties in finding employees with the right skills, while another half report some difficulties. In 2024, the Commission has identified 42 occupations that face worker shortages across the EU. These include jobs in construction, transport, agriculture, hospitality, health and social care. The 2024 Labour shortages and surpluses in Europe Report by ELA describes that many of these sectors are essential for the good functioning and competitiveness of the European economy.
With the unemployment rates in the EU hitting record lows (see Eurostat), people from abroad help fill the gaps. According to Eurostat, non-EU citizens take more often jobs with simple, routine or physical tasks that Europeans cannot or don’t want to do. Employment of non-EU workers brings important benefits to the local and regional economies. In OECD countries, a quarter of low-skilled workers in essential occupations in cities are migrants, twice as high as in rural areas. Without migrant workers, many hospitals, transport operators, construction companies, restaurants or grocery stores would not be able to provide services at the required level.
EU migration policy is grounded in the respect for fundamental rights, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees. These legal foundations guarantee the right to asylum, the prohibition of collective expulsions, and the protection of human dignity. Upholding these a law-based order is central to the EU’s identity and values, ensuring that migration management is not only effective but also aligned with international human rights standards.
The EU Migration and Asylum Pact further strengthens the respect of fundamental rights. It harmonises criteria for international protection, introduces monitoring and establishes reception standards. The reform creates new safeguards for asylum seekers and vulnerable people and introduces free legal counselling for all applicants. The EU also has dedicated funds and operational support to improve reception capacities in its Member States. For example in Greece, the EU has helped to set up, upgrade and operate 22 facilities that provide basic shelter, food or legal aid to asylum seekers.
Integration is widely regarded as a two-way process, requiring active participation from all parties: those with the right to stay; host societies; and public administrations. According to the latest Eurobarometer on integration and immigration, 70 % of Europeans agree that both newcomers and host communities must share responsibility for successful integration.
For Europeans, learning the local language is the most important factor that helps integration. Other important aspects include: the migrants’ contribution to the welfare system (paying taxes); being committed to the way of life in the host society; and having education and skills that are sufficient to find a job. Details are available in the Special Eurobarometer 519.
Over four million Ukrainian refugees enjoy temporary protection in the EU. Many have found work or set up businesses within months after arriving to the EU. They contribute to the public systems with their taxes and social security transfers. While there are no common statistics for the whole EU, for example in Poland, according to a recent study by UNHCR and Deloitte, the presence of the refugees from Ukraine generated 2.7% of Poland’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study also foresees the refugees from Ukraine will continue having a positive economic impact while they remain in Poland, vastly outstripping the cost of any support they received. In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Social affairs reports that Ukrainian refugees contribute more to the public budgets than what they receive as support.
Some refugees, however, face linguistic and administrative barriers to employment. EU Member States roll-out programmes to help them learn the language or gain national certification in their domain. Thanks to the EU Temporary protection, people fleeing the war in Ukraine benefit from various rights in the EU such as the access to employment, education or medical care. Following the latest EU Member State decision, the temporary protection will last until March 2027.

New European Partnership on One Health AMR: €253 million for research and innovation against antimicrobial resistance,https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/new-european-partnership-one-health-amr-eu253-million-research-and-innovation-against-antimicrobial-2025-09-23_en,23 September 2025,"Research and innovation news alert: Today, the European Union has officially launched the Partnership on One Health Antimicrobial Resistance (OHAMR).","Today, the European Union has officially launched the Partnership on One Health Antimicrobial Resistance (OHAMR). Co-funded by Horizon Europe with €75 million, this ambitious 10-year programme tackles the urgent global health threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
Ekaterina Zaharieva, European Commissioner for Startups, Research and Innovation said:
“Europe is ready to lead in the global fight against antimicrobial resistance. This partnership embodies our commitment to step up, innovate, and protect the foundations of modern medicine.”
AMR causes over 35,000 deaths annually in the EU and 1.27 million worldwide (2019), with projections of up to 10 million per year by 2050. It occurs when microbes like bacteria or viruses become resistant to treatments, driven by antimicrobial misuse, poor infection control, and limited diagnostics. AMR is a threat to modern medicine that strains health systems as well as economies.
Coordinated by the Swedish Research Council, OHAMR brings together 53 organisations from 30 countries, and it uses a One Health approach to connect sectors and accelerate solutions reducing antimicrobial use and resistance. Activities planned under the partnership include:
The EU has supported AMR research through its Framework Programmes. Funding from Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020, in the period from 2014 until now, amounts to EUR 1.18 billion for 416 projects. It has supported projects, coordination actions, and partnerships to boost knowledge sharing, build capacity, and develop tools to detect, prevent, and treat resistant infections.
Building on the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR), which invested over €180 million since 2011, OHAMR responds to the objectives of the 2023 Council recommendation on AMR with a One Health approach and will support the 2017 European One Health Action Plan against AMR.
This partnership will contribute to the implementation of the Strategy for European Life Sciences by promoting a One Health approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, a key principle outlined in the strategy. By supporting the development and market uptake of innovative tools to tackle AMR, this partnership will help achieve the strategy's objective to position the EU as the world’s most attractive place for life sciences by 2030.

EU and Moldova extend Road Transport Agreement until 31 March 2027,https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-and-moldova-extend-road-transport-agreement-until-31-march-2027-2025-09-23_en,23 September 2025,The EU and Moldova decided to extend the validity of their current Road Transport Agreement until 31 March 2027. The Agreement is designed to support Moldova's access to global markets by facilitating transit through EU countries and strengthening the country's connections with the EU market.,"The EU and Moldova decided to extend the validity of their current Road Transport Agreement until 31 March 2027. The Agreement is designed to support Moldova's access to global markets by facilitating transit through EU countries and strengthening the country's connections with the EU market. Since its initial signing on 29 June 2022, the Agreement has significantly boosted road exports, benefitting of both economies.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: “We are very pleased to extend the Road Transport Agreement with Moldova, which has already proven to be a real success. It has provided vital support to the Moldovan economy in the wake of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, while also boosting EU exports to Moldova. This extension is a tangible demonstration of the EU's continued support for Moldova and of the steady integration of our economies.”
The Agreement with Moldova was first established following the loss of important transport routes passing through Ukraine's Black Sea ports and export markets to the east of Ukraine, due to Russia's war of aggression. By partly liberalising road freight transport through giving transit and bilateral transport rights to Moldovan and EU hauliers for their respective territories, the Agreement supports deeper integration of the Moldovan market into the EU. It has also strengthened the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes since Moldova is an important country of transit for Ukrainian exports and imports.
Exports by road from Moldova to the EU increased by 57% in volume and 41% in value terms in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in 2021 (before the Agreement). The EU also greatly benefited from the Agreement: EU exports by road to Moldova increased by 49% in value and 36% in volume terms in the same period.

Acceptance of sustainable solar energy systems is influenced by household age,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/acceptance-sustainable-solar-energy-systems-influenced-household-age-2025-09-23_en,23 September 2025,"Household age is often overlooked when considering ways to encourage uptake of solar energy systems and increase their circularity. A study addresses this gap, finding that interest in and adoption of solar energy rises to age 65 before declining.","Two significant societal transformations of the 21st Century are population ageing, and our transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Solar photovoltaics (PV) – e.g. solar panels – are a notable contributor to the sustainable energy transition and have been highlighted as a technology that supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, PVs also bring high levels of associated waste in their production and proliferation through to end-of-life; as such, policymakers and industry are exploring ways to lessen the impact of PVs using circular economy strategies and business models.
An equitable circular economy must be inclusive and accessible for all households, but research has highlighted that adoption of PVs suffers from socioeconomic and demographic inequalities. Studies have shown a positive correlation between uptake of PVs and household wealth and income, for instance, and have explored characteristics such as educational level, household size, risk aversion, and energy consumption needs.
However, one characteristic that has been overlooked to date is household age, say the researchers behind a new study. Despite being a key consideration in the successful design of fiscal, social and labour market policy, this dimension is often ignored when considering circular approaches to both foster uptake of renewable energy and reduce PV waste.
To address this knowledge gap, the researchers surveyed households in Flanders, Belgium, where there is a high adoption rate of photovoltaic solar energy panels (solar PV). They assessed 2,966 users and 877 non-users of solar PV installations.
They found that adoption rates for solar PV equipment use and circular economy solutions increased with age up to 65 years, followed by a decline in the over-70s. Reasons for solar PV adoption/non-adoption varied by age; interest in technology and solar energy dropped sharply as age increased, with short payback times and return on investment making solar PV less appealing. Among the over-70s, feeling ""too old"" became a reason not to invest.
More younger households said upfront cost was a barrier (noted by 37% of under-45s) but cost was the most frequently reported reason for non-adoption across all ages, falling to 24% among the over-70s. Notably, lower-educated households deemed themselves too old for solar PV sooner than their highly educated counterparts. Living in a detached house also had a significant negative effect on solar PV adoption for 45 to 69-year-olds.
In terms of circular business models for solar PV, the researchers noted that it is essential to understand socio-demographic differences such as customer age and education in fostering increased uptake, as these factors shape a citizen's learning, knowledge, familiarity, and interest in solar PV adoption or circularity. Business strategies and policy approaches that can be used to increase the uptake and circularity of solar PVs include improved recycling, remanufacturing, refurbishment, repair and reuse; offering incentives to promote uptake of solar PV equipment; and educating potential customers more clearly on their options.
For example, technology providers can retain ownership of solar PV installations (panels) in what is called a product service system (PSS). This encourages a reuse market and reduces customer concerns around sourcing, maintenance and repair. The researchers found that, while interest in solar PSS also decreased with age, older users familiar with other existing PSS (such as Netflix) were generally more interested in solar PSS and PV reuse models, highlighting potential avenues for targeted marketing strategies. The most important value for people of all ages with an interest in solar PSS was the reduction of technical risks. However, its importance declined with age. Conversely, the environmental benefits of solar PSS become increasingly important among older age groups. In terms of deterrents for using PSS, preference for ownership was a major barrier across all ages.
Older generations tended to perceive lower levels of risk but be more sensitive to regulatory uncertainty. This is unsurprising, say the researchers, as solar PV policies have been inconsistent in Flanders over the last 20 years, fluctuating between subsidies and taxes.
Regarding end-of-contract options – transfer of ownership after 20 years with an optional service contract for maintenance and repair, or removal of the panels – older households were indifferent or inconclusive compared to younger households, suggesting that the end-of-contract period was beyond the horizon of many older households.
Finally, a lack of clarity regarding contractual terms in the event of moving or death was a concern that increased significantly with age. In ownership models, solar PV installations were attached to the house and typically jointly sold or inherited as part of the property. Respondents were uncertain about what would occur in PSS situations.
Based on the findings, the study proposed policy recommendations to encourage uptake of solar PV and align circular approaches with the needs of various demographics:
The findings provide insights for businesses, policymakers and researchers, demonstrating that the rollout of solar PV and transition to a circular economy require a nuanced, diversified approach tailored to the preferences and barriers facing each age group.

"How do we boost flood resilience in cities? Addressing social vulnerability is key, a new study finds.",https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/how-do-we-boost-flood-resilience-cities-addressing-social-vulnerability-key-new-study-finds-2025-09-23_en,23 September 2025,A case study in Barcelona mapped high-risk hotspots for major flood events as climate change increases stormwater frequency. It highlighted social vulnerability as a major factor that must be addressed.,"By 2050, nearly 70% of the world’s population is projected to live in cities. Urban populations are growing, putting ever more people at risk from extreme climate-driven events related to stormwater, including surface water flooding and combined sewer overflows.
Increasing the resilience of cities to such events is critical. This forms part of major European Union policy initiatives such as the EU Adaptation Strategy, through which the bloc aims for climate resilience by 2050, and the new European Water Resilience Strategy, which aims to restore and protect the water cycle to ensure flood resilience. Effective water management in cities is also a priority for EU legislation and funding: the Floods Directive requires EU member states to identify at-risk areas and plan coordinated mitigation, and the EU’s Cohesion Policy provides financing to reduce social and economic disparities and encourage investment in climate adaptation.
To improve policy impact, better information is needed on the specific risks and vulnerabilities facing European cities. New research considers the case study of Barcelona, Spain, a coastal city exposed to significant flood risk. It examines climate risk not purely as a physical system but as an integrated ‘Social-Ecological-Technological System’ (SETS). This approach takes an overview of interconnected factors such as the consumption of contaminated water, the harm to aquatic ecosystems and street drainage.
The researchers looked at the city’s exposure to sewer overflows and surface water flooding, and the threat levels these pose, and created an urban risk index, calculating the hazards of each event using hydrological and hydraulic modelling for sewer overflows and flooding, and historical observations for sewers.
To assess the exposure risk to city dwellers, they investigated population density, proximity to public beaches and sewer points. They evaluated social vulnerability by considering income, government welfare needs, language, and the ratio of minors and senior citizens. They looked at ecological vulnerability including connectivity, biodiversity and green spaces, and technological vulnerability including urban surfaces and sewer capacity. They analysed connections between vulnerabilities, hazards and exposures, and used this information to map high-risk communities and hotspots.
The researchers found that the major factor determining overall water-related risk in Barcelona was social vulnerability, with “disproportionate impacts” hitting vulnerable communities – specifically older people and children; and people who are poorer, less healthy or from minority ethnic groups. Other factors increasing risk were sparse vegetation and ageing drainage systems identified as “technological lock-ins” in the sewer system, meaning that approaches which were once considered cutting-edge – such as storing run-off during rain events – were now outdated, and smart technologies were needed.
The findings highlight the difficulty of future-proofing cities against more extreme events without also considering the underlying problems that may affect the success of a chosen intervention. They act as a proof of concept for using a SETS approach to inform policy to increase a city’s climate resilience, the researchers concluded. This could mean a move away from focusing purely on technological considerations. They suggested that an integrated approach to flood risk management could be employed – one that would reduce hazards whilst also reducing vulnerabilities. An example of such an approach could be to strategically develop green spaces in economically disadvantaged areas.
The approach used would be applicable to other cities with similar problems. The researchers propose a series of policy recommendations to reduce the risks associated with extreme climate events.
These included a move to greater social equity in climate adaptation, with policies specifically aimed at helping vulnerable communities; modernising urban water systems to include smart technologies such as decentralised rainwater harvesting; improving access to data around urban water systems; and investing in green infrastructure such as rain gardens, green roofs and urban wetlands to mitigate runoff.

They absorb and remove pollutants and excess nutrients from wastewater, eutrophic water or urban stormwater runoff and offer a promising method of bioremediation (the use of organisms to remove contamination). In this way, the rafts deliver benefits for the environment, society and the economy.
So far, research in this area has primarily focused on their ability to clean contaminated or polluted water, but the new study confirms how they also boost biodiversity thanks to the role of plants and the beneficial microbes which colonise the plant rafts.
As an experiment, researchers set up floating islands in a 48-metre-perimeter, 1.2-metre deep artificial stormwater pond in rural Portugal. The cork-based rafts contained four locally available perennial plant species: bearded iris Iris germanica (4 plants), marsh marigold Caltha palustris (2 plants), sweet flag grass Acorus gramineus (4 plants), and bulrush Typha latifolia (2 plants). The islands were established in 2018 and sampled again in 2022. The pond was fed by water from a second artificial pond, mixed with stormwater from surrounding woods and agricultural fields.
The researchers assessed the culturable bacterial communities that colonised the floating platform and root system, and the invertebrate biodiversity associated with the rafts and the pond margin. The study identified 30 freshwater ecosystem bacterial strains living among the plant roots and on the platform surfaces. They found that bacteria capable of producing plant-growth-boosting molecules were thriving on the rafts. Among the plants, A. gramineus dominated the platforms, with a well-established root system.
The islands were found to be functioning as biodiversity hotspots and promoting ecosystem regeneration, providing shelter, food and breeding sites for insects. Of particular note, researchers found the rafts supported the complete lifecycle of at least 10 different species of dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata). These predatory insects play crucial roles in ecosystem food webs, and they are used as biological indicator species of aquatic ecosystem health. Other studies have found these platforms can also support a wide range of invertebrates, amphibians, fish, reptiles and birds.
The rafts mostly retained their structural integrity, however they were releasing cork oak particles after six years. The type of cork used in this study might be less suitable for longer-term use than, for example, a cork oak bark.
Overall, the study showed that these floating islands can promote and support diverse beneficial pond bacteria communities, without compromising bioremediation, aesthetics or water management. The study broadens existing research on their use to address ecosystem degradation, widening the focus from bioremediation to biodiversity enhancement. The findings show the potential of artificial floating islands for establishing biodiverse communities in stormwater or agricultural runoff pools.
The European Commission is funding research and innovation on nature-based solutions, as part of projects such as Horizon Europe, to help achieve Sustainable Development Goals and protect people and planet.  Under the Nature Restoration Regulation, a key element of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the European Green Deal, member states are required to restore ecosystems through national restoration plans. These plans can include a wide variety of restoration measures, ranging from passive recovery to active interventions.
Nature based solutions also feature prominently in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework adopted by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2022 and are being targeted by a global partnership, ENACT, launched the same year at COP 27 to address climate change, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, with a focus on protecting, conserving and restoring aquatic ecosystems.

Seven facts to help understand migration,https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/seven-facts-help-understand-migration-2025-09-23_en,23 September 2025,"Public debate about migration is often driven by sensationalist news and emotional, polarising statements. It can be difficult to keep track and distinguish between opinions, facts and willful manipulation. The following facts could contribute to a more balanced debate on migration.","Public debate about migration is often driven by sensationalist news and emotional, polarising statements. It can be difficult to keep track and distinguish between opinions, facts and willful manipulation. The following facts could contribute to a more balanced debate on migration and EU migration policy.
Europeans tend to think that there are more migrants in their society than there are in reality. According to the most recent Eurobarometer on integration of migrants (2022), 68% of respondents overestimated the real share of migrants in the population. The figure varies between EU Member States but on average, Europeans believe that 16% of their country's population are non-EU citizens, while the actual share is less than 7%.
For context, more than 93% of people living in the EU are EU citizens. Latest Eurostat data shows that in 2024, 29 million people living in the EU were non-EU citizens, representing 6.4% of total EU population (Poland and Sweden don’t count refugees from Ukraine in these statistics). The number grew from 21 million (5%) in 2019.
The EU is working to control external borders and limit irregular migration. In 2024, Frontex reported 239 000 irregular border crossings, 25% less than in 2023. The numbers continued to drop on all the monitored routes also in the first 7 months of 2025.
The Commission works closely with EU countries and agencies, international partners and non-governmental organisations to prevent irregular migration and ensure the dignified return of those who are not eligible to stay in the EU. An important driver of reduced irregular border crossings is a more targeted effort by EU and national authorities to dismantle migrant smuggling networks. Agreements and partnerships between the EU and African countries such as Tunisia, Egypt or Mauritania have also helped to limit irregular departures from these countries.
The EU has clear and transparent rules allowing people to enter and reside on its territory. Most people entering the EU come through legal migration channels, such as work, study, family reunification, or resettlement. These legal pathways mainly help address EU labour market needs. Based on the latest data in 2023, more than 3.9 million non-EU citizens obtained the right to both reside and work in the EU. Nearly 90 000 highly qualified non-EU workers received an EU Blue Card. These numbers are significantly higher than the number of irregular border crossings (around 380 000 in 2023 and 239 000 in 2024).
The EU lacks workers. According to the recent report by Mario Draghi, around a quarter of European companies have faced difficulties in finding employees with the right skills, while another half report some difficulties. In 2024, the Commission has identified 42 occupations that face worker shortages across the EU. These include jobs in construction, transport, agriculture, hospitality, health and social care. The 2024 Labour shortages and surpluses in Europe Report by ELA describes that many of these sectors are essential for the good functioning and competitiveness of the European economy.
With the unemployment rates in the EU hitting record lows (see Eurostat), people from abroad help fill the gaps. According to Eurostat, non-EU citizens take more often jobs with simple, routine or physical tasks that Europeans cannot or don’t want to do. Employment of non-EU workers brings important benefits to the local and regional economies. In OECD countries, a quarter of low-skilled workers in essential occupations in cities are migrants, twice as high as in rural areas. Without migrant workers, many hospitals, transport operators, construction companies, restaurants or grocery stores would not be able to provide services at the required level.
EU migration policy is grounded in the respect for fundamental rights, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees. These legal foundations guarantee the right to asylum, the prohibition of collective expulsions, and the protection of human dignity. Upholding these a law-based order is central to the EU’s identity and values, ensuring that migration management is not only effective but also aligned with international human rights standards.
The EU Migration and Asylum Pact further strengthens the respect of fundamental rights. It harmonises criteria for international protection, introduces monitoring and establishes reception standards. The reform creates new safeguards for asylum seekers and vulnerable people and introduces free legal counselling for all applicants. The EU also has dedicated funds and operational support to improve reception capacities in its Member States. For example in Greece, the EU has helped to set up, upgrade and operate 22 facilities that provide basic shelter, food or legal aid to asylum seekers.
Integration is widely regarded as a two-way process, requiring active participation from all parties: those with the right to stay; host societies; and public administrations. According to the latest Eurobarometer on integration and immigration, 70 % of Europeans agree that both newcomers and host communities must share responsibility for successful integration.
For Europeans, learning the local language is the most important factor that helps integration. Other important aspects include: the migrants’ contribution to the welfare system (paying taxes); being committed to the way of life in the host society; and having education and skills that are sufficient to find a job. Details are available in the Special Eurobarometer 519.
Over four million Ukrainian refugees enjoy temporary protection in the EU. Many have found work or set up businesses within months after arriving to the EU. They contribute to the public systems with their taxes and social security transfers. While there are no common statistics for the whole EU, for example in Poland, according to a recent study by UNHCR and Deloitte, the presence of the refugees from Ukraine generated 2.7% of Poland’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study also foresees the refugees from Ukraine will continue having a positive economic impact while they remain in Poland, vastly outstripping the cost of any support they received. In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Social affairs reports that Ukrainian refugees contribute more to the public budgets than what they receive as support.
Some refugees, however, face linguistic and administrative barriers to employment. EU Member States roll-out programmes to help them learn the language or gain national certification in their domain. Thanks to the EU Temporary protection, people fleeing the war in Ukraine benefit from various rights in the EU such as the access to employment, education or medical care. Following the latest EU Member State decision, the temporary protection will last until March 2027.

It offers a practical and future-oriented tool to identify, define, and develop the key competences needed for a competitive and sustainable blue economy.
What is BlueComp?
BlueComp is both practical and forward-looking. It maps the competences that workers, educators, policymakers, and businesses need to respond to the rapid transformation of the EU's blue economy. The framework bridges education, employment, and policy, ensuring that skills development aligns with sectoral needs and EU priorities, such as the Ocean Pact, the Union of Skills, and the green and digital transitions.
It is organised into four dimensions each with competences defined across five mastery levels (from basic to expert), aligned with EU frameworks such as the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and ESCO. These can be combined to fit a specific blue job – like assembling pieces of a puzzle:
It is useful for educators and training providers, policymakers and public authorities, employers and researchers, project consortia, and innovation networks.
The way forward
The framework represents a foundational step toward a more structured approach to skills development in the sustainable blue economy, by offering a shared vocabulary and a practical reference for designing, aligning, and implementing capacity-building actions across Europe.

Moldova successfully completes its screening process,https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/moldova-successfully-completes-its-screening-process-2025-09-22_en,22 September 2025,"Today, Moldova has reached an important milestone on its EU accession path with the completion of the bilateral screening with the European Commission. The bilateral screening began in July 2024","Today, Moldova has reached an important milestone on its EU accession path with the completion of the bilateral screening with the European Commission. The bilateral screening began in July 2024, and the rapid completion was made possible by Moldova’s dedication, professionalism and motivation to deliver on reforms, align with EU standards, and join the EU family.
The screening process shows that accession negotiations are a whole-of-society exercise. It involves the entire public administration, with topics ranging from food safety standards, clean water or support to farmers being discussed. It is a key part of EU accession negotiations, and its successful conclusion brings Moldova one step closer to EU accession.
During the bilateral screening, the Commission and Moldova carried out a thorough examination of each policy field (also known as negotiation chapters) and Moldova’s compliance with the EU acquis in each area, and Moldova set out clear plans to align with the rules. This process enables the Commission to determine how well-prepared Moldova is for membership and forms an important technical basis for further progress in the negotiations.
The Commission presents the results of the screening to Member States in screening reports, in which it can recommend that they open negotiations in the relevant policy fields.
Once Member States agree, the negotiation chapters, which are part of broader thematic clusters, can be opened. Moldova is expected to continue its reform efforts, align with EU legislation and strengthen its institutional and administrative capacity, guided by the benchmarks to be set by the Member States. Cluster 1 on the fundamentals – such as the rule of law, fundamental rights and functioning democratic institutions – is always the first to be opened and the last to be closed.

Commission approves €11.7 million of aid granted to Carcassonne airport and orders France to recover €1.8 million,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2140,22 September 2025,The Commission has approved €11.7 million in State aid granted to the manager of Carcassonne airport between 2001 and 2011. The European Commission has also concluded that certain agreements signed over the same period between the Carcassonne airport and airlines operating at that airport,"The Commission has approved €11.7 million in State aid granted to the manager of Carcassonne airport between 2001 and 2011. The European Commission has also concluded that certain agreements signed over the same period between the Carcassonne airport and airlines operating at that airport (in this case Ryanair) amounted to around €1.8 million in incompatible State aid. France will now have to recover this amount.
The Commission's investigation
On 4 April 2012, following a complaint, the Commission opened an in-depth investigation to assess whether agreements between Ryanair and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Carcassonne-Limoux-Castelnaudary (‘CCI'), a public entity and manager of Carcassonne airport until 2011, as well as government funding to CCI, were in line with EU State aid rules.
The Commission found that, between 2001 and 2011, CCI received subsidies, mainly from local and regional authorities, including €9 million to support investments to finance Carcassonne airport's infrastructure, as well as €2.7 million to support CCI's operations. The Commission concluded that these €11.7 million in subsidies granted to CCI are allowed under the Aviation Guidelines, the sectoral rules applicable to operating or investment aid to airports. The aid was necessary and proportionate to the objectives pursued, since it contributed to the necessary modernisation of the airport and the financing of its operating costs without generating excessive profits. The Commission also concluded that the aid would not unduly distort competition with nearby airports such as Castres-Mazamet, Perpignan, Béziers and Toulouse-Blagnac. The Commission further found that €1.1 million in subsidies was used to finance activities outside the market, such as firefighting and customs control, and is therefore outside the scope of EU State aid rules.
In the same period, CCI signed a number of agreements with Ryanair and its subsidiary AMS, which dealt specifically with marketing. The contracts concerned both marketing services and airport services agreements. CCI paid out a total of €8.9 million to Ryanair and AMS for marketing services. The services agreements set out airport charges applied to Ryanair, as well as a commitment from the airline to operate certain routes to Carcassonne and reaching certain passenger targets.
The Commission today concluded that 11 marketing and airport services agreements signed between CCI and Ryanair/AMS constituted incompatible State aid. The Commission assessed the profitability of 16 of these agreements to the airport, to determine whether a private operator would have signed similar contracts (the so-called market economy operator or ‘MEOP‘ test). The test consists of calculating the net present value (‘NPV‘) of the agreements for CCI, based on the expected revenues and costs associated with them. A positive NPV means that the agreement is profitable and fulfils the MEOP test, while a negative NPV means that it does not and provides an advantage to Ryanair equivalent to the value of the NPV, as a market operator would not have concluded such an agreement.
The Commission found that 11 of the 16 contracts conferred an advantage on Ryanair. The profitability of the contracts evolved to the benefit of Ryanair because CCI started paying higher marketing fees to Ryanair, for similar services, while reducing its passenger charges.
The total advantage conferred on Ryanair amounts to €1.8 million. France must now recover the incompatible aid, plus interest. As a matter of principle, EU rules require that incompatible State aid is recovered without delay in order to remove the distortion of competition created by the aid. The purpose of recovery is to restore the situation which existed in the internal market before the aid was paid, and hence does not constitute a fine. By paying back the unlawful aid, the beneficiary forfeits the advantage which it has enjoyed over its competitors.
Background
Under EU State aid rules, public interventions involving companies can be considered free of State aid when they are made on terms that a private operator, placed in the same conditions as the State, would accept under market conditions. If this principle is not complied with, public interventions typically involve State aid within the meaning of Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as they confer an economic advantage on beneficiaries with respect to their competitors.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.33962 in the State aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the Competition Weekly e-News.

It offers a practical and future-oriented tool to identify, define, and develop the key competences needed for a competitive and sustainable blue economy.
What is BlueComp?
BlueComp is both practical and forward-looking. It maps the competences that workers, educators, policymakers, and businesses need to respond to the rapid transformation of the EU's blue economy. The framework bridges education, employment, and policy, ensuring that skills development aligns with sectoral needs and EU priorities, such as the Ocean Pact, the Union of Skills, and the green and digital transitions.
It is organised into four dimensions each with competences defined across five mastery levels (from basic to expert), aligned with EU frameworks such as the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and ESCO. These can be combined to fit a specific blue job – like assembling pieces of a puzzle:
It is useful for educators and training providers, policymakers and public authorities, employers and researchers, project consortia, and innovation networks.
The way forward
The framework represents a foundational step toward a more structured approach to skills development in the sustainable blue economy, by offering a shared vocabulary and a practical reference for designing, aligning, and implementing capacity-building actions across Europe.

Moldova successfully completes its screening process,https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/moldova-successfully-completes-its-screening-process-2025-09-22_en,22 September 2025,"Today, Moldova has reached an important milestone on its EU accession path with the completion of the bilateral screening with the European Commission. The bilateral screening began in July 2024","Today, Moldova has reached an important milestone on its EU accession path with the completion of the bilateral screening with the European Commission. The bilateral screening began in July 2024, and the rapid completion was made possible by Moldova’s dedication, professionalism and motivation to deliver on reforms, align with EU standards, and join the EU family.
The screening process shows that accession negotiations are a whole-of-society exercise. It involves the entire public administration, with topics ranging from food safety standards, clean water or support to farmers being discussed. It is a key part of EU accession negotiations, and its successful conclusion brings Moldova one step closer to EU accession.
During the bilateral screening, the Commission and Moldova carried out a thorough examination of each policy field (also known as negotiation chapters) and Moldova’s compliance with the EU acquis in each area, and Moldova set out clear plans to align with the rules. This process enables the Commission to determine how well-prepared Moldova is for membership and forms an important technical basis for further progress in the negotiations.
The Commission presents the results of the screening to Member States in screening reports, in which it can recommend that they open negotiations in the relevant policy fields.
Once Member States agree, the negotiation chapters, which are part of broader thematic clusters, can be opened. Moldova is expected to continue its reform efforts, align with EU legislation and strengthen its institutional and administrative capacity, guided by the benchmarks to be set by the Member States. Cluster 1 on the fundamentals – such as the rule of law, fundamental rights and functioning democratic institutions – is always the first to be opened and the last to be closed.

Seveso III Implementation Report: European industrial safety improved,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/seveso-report-european-industrial-safety-improved-2025-09-19_en,19 September 2025,A new report on the implementation of the Seveso III Directive on industrial accidents and safety finds an overall improvement across the EU.,"A new report published Friday (19 Sep) finds that industrial installations have improved the handling of hazardous substances. The Commission Report on the Implementation of the Seveso III Directive (Directive 2012/18/EU) finds that installations throughout Europe are now operating more safely.
The legislation, aimed at preventing major accidents involving dangerous substances, has been instrumental in improving industrial safety in the EU.
Thanks to the Seveso III Directive, the EU benefits from common industrial safety norms and a strong safety culture. This helps prevent industrial accidents and mitigate their harmful consequences when they do occur.
The Directive safeguards the environment and the health of workers at industrial installations and local residents. It also strengthens the EU’s competitiveness by ensuring a stable and secure industrial environment.
The second implementation report of the Directive shows progress compared to previous years. From 2019 to 2022, the average annual number of major industrial accidents was under 22, with these accidents having less damaging impacts.
Still, even one accident is too many. Continued implementation of the Directive will help maintain and further enhance industrial safety.
Despite the positive news, there are still challenges concerning inspections, testing of external emergency plans, and public information. The Commission is committed to supporting Member States in fully implementing the Seveso III Directive. Safety is more than a cost; it is an investment that benefits society as a whole.
The Seveso III Directive covers over 11,000 industrial installations across the European Union. It includes a wide range of sectors, such as the chemical and petrochemical industry, refineries, production of pharmaceuticals, manufacture of food products and beverages, and agriculture, among others.
Strict rules apply to installations handling high amounts of dangerous substances, for instance, on inspections and access to information.
This Directive is recognised as a global benchmark for industrial accident policy. Its second implementation report, covering the period 2019-2022, follows a first report on the period 2015-18.

Commission welcomes RENURE agreement in Nitrates Committee,https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-welcomes-renure-agreement-nitrates-committee-2025-09-19_en,19 September 2025,"Standing for 'Recovered Nitrogen from Manure', RENURE fertilisers are made from processed manure.","The Commission has welcomed the support given by EU Member States for its RENURE proposal on Friday (19 Sep).
By allowing the use of RENURE fertilisers above the limit for the application of manure and processed manure set by the Nitrates Directive, Member States and farmers will have the possibility to replace chemical fertilisers with RENURE fertilisers.
This will be done safely to ensure the continued protection of waters and the environment. It will also reduce costs for farmers and increase the strategic autonomy of the EU agricultural sector.
Following today's meeting of the Nitrates Committee, the Commission's RENURE proposal will be shared with the European Parliament and the Council for a three-month scrutiny period. If there are no objections from the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission will be able to adopt this amendment to the Nitrates Directive.
Established by the Nitrates Directive, the Nitrates Committee is composed of Member States' Representatives. It assists the Commission on matters relating to the implementation of this Directive and to its adaptation to scientific and technical progress.
The amendment would apply only in Member States choosing to authorise RENURE. They will need to transpose the amendment into national law.
Speaking on the issue, Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience and a Competitive Circular Economy, Jessika Roswall, said:
""The use of RENURE fertilisers can support efficient nutrients management and make our agriculture more resilient, while remaining safe for the environment. Our proposal gives flexibility for those Member States that wish to use RENURE fertilisers, while ensuring that pollution hotspots can be tackled. This is a concrete step towards empowering our farmers while protecting our shared natural resources."""

The European Commissioner for International Partnership and President of Namibia discussed a comprehensive package under the EU Global Gateway agenda, which has mobilised €1.3 billion (NAD 25 billion) in loans and grants, expected to leverage over € 20 billion (NAD 400 billion) in private investments. This package supports Namibia’s ambitions to become a global leader in sustainable energy and green industrial transformation. It includes innovative projects such as HyIron and Cleanergy, alongside investments in transport networks, electricity grids, port infrastructure, and vocational training.
Discussions also focused on Critical Raw Materials (CRM). Commissioner Síkela emphasied the need to ensure that Europe and Namibia together invest in the creating of local value chains – processing of CRM, refining, which ensure that more of the value of the final product enriches the local society as well as new quality jobs in innovative sector. European approach at the same time focuses on high environmental and social standards like the €1.8 million support to cooperation between the Namibian Geological Survey and EU partners and expressed readiness to identify strategic projects and attract European investment.
The DEVE Committee Chair and senior members also paid a visit to the National Assembly of Namibia, meeting with Speaker of the National Assembly, Hon. Saara Amadhila, and the standing committees on Economy, Industry, Public Administration and Planning, and Gender Equality, Social Development and Family Affairs. Discussed focussed on anchoring the EU-Namibia partnership in shared values and mutual commitment through parliamentary dialogue to foster transparency, accountability, and democratic values.
The joint delegation further met representatives from the private sector, UN, the diplomatic community, civil society and media touching on all areas of human development, including education, health and governance.
Background:
The EU and Namibia are committed partners, celebrating this year the 35th anniversary of bilateral relations. Team Europe is Namibia’s biggest trade and development partner, with a positive trade surplus for Namibia supporting local and regional value chains.
Global Gateway is the EU’s contribution of €300 billion to narrowing the global investment gap worldwide. It is in line with the commitment of the G7 leaders from June 2021 to launch a values-driven, high-standard and transparent infrastructure partnership to meet global infrastructure development needs. Global Gateway is also fully aligned with the UN’s Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the Paris Agreement."
New Study Highlights State of play in Digitalisation in EU Agriculture,https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/media/news/new-study-highlights-state-play-digitalisation-eu-agriculture-2025-09-19_en,19 September 2025,"New study shows digitalisation is reshaping farming. Most farmers use digital tools and expect economic, environmental & social benefits. An interactive dashboard highlights trends, while untapped potential remains in data use and interoperability.","A new report from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), “The state of digitalisation in EU agriculture: Insights from farm surveys”, has been published, offering insight into how technology is changing European farming.
The study shows an encouraging picture. Among farmers surveyed, 93% reported using at least one IT or software tool, with 79% deploying at least one crop-specific technology and 83% using at least one livestock-specific tool. Farmers are also mostly optimistic about the impact of digitalisation: 76% expect it will lead to economic benefits, 72% foresee environmental gains, and 67% anticipate positive social outcomes.
To support policymakers, managers and researchers, the study is accompanied by an interactive dashboard. This tool visualises the data and highlights key trends, making it easier to identify where action is most needed.
Despite the progress, the report stresses that significant untapped potential remains. Improved data digitalisation and interoperability are seen as vital for reducing administrative burdens for the benefit of farmers and agricultural workers."
Satellite Tech and Smart Data Take Root in Europe’s Farming Future,https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/media/news/satellite-tech-and-smart-data-take-root-europes-farming-future-2025-09-19_en,19 September 2025,ICE Conference Member States sharing experiences and best practices in the implementation of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) and its quality assessment,"In Reims, the annual EU conference on agricultural monitoring and policy innovation.
Against the backdrop of growing environmental pressures and rapid digital change, Reims welcomed over 400 experts, policymakers, and industry professionals for the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) Community Exchange Conference (ICE).
Organised by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG AGRI), in partnership with the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the French Services and Payment Agency (ASP), the annual flagship conference focused on practical ways satellite technology and data systems are helping Member States manage farmland more efficiently and transparently.
From real-time monitoring of agricultural parcels to giving farmers more control over their data, 2025 ICE offered a hands-on look at how IACS is evolving to support the next phase of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) beyond 2027.
The 2025 edition of ICE highlighted the transformative role of satellite-based Area Monitoring Systems (AMS) in CAP delivery. With AMS now fully automating area-based payments, farmers can adjust their applications almost up to the payment date, helping avoid penalties and reducing paperwork. In 2024 alone, over 3 million hectares were corrected thanks to AMS.
AMS is no longer questioned. Member States are seeing a return on investment through reduced administrative burden and fewer on-the-spot checks,
said Nicola Britta Holsten, Deputy Head of Unit for CAP Strategic Plans Coordination, DG AGRI.
The exchanges confirmed the value of IACS as a uniquely comprehensive system—combining AMS, the Geospatial Aid Application (GSA), and the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS)—which covers more than 90% of EU agricultural land. This integrated approach improves accuracy and reduces the need for on-site farm inspections, easing the workload for both farmers and administrations.
The conference looked ahead to the future of CAP, with strong interest in expanding Earth Observation to forest and soil health, and combining satellite data with other sources like machinery and lab results. These ideas are reflected in the proposed European Land Monitoring System (ELMS).
“The post-2027 CAP must put the farmer at the centre, granting them ownership of their data,” echoed several Member State delegates during panel discussions.
“We welcome ELMS as a voluntary tool that allows Member States to innovate while respecting farmers’ rights,” noted a representative from the French Paying Agency.
2025 ICE also addressed the importance of data sharing and the need for continuity in satellite infrastructure. Member States called on ESA and European Commission’s Directorate-General for Defence to maintain the current Sentinel-2 satellite configuration and support civil agricultural monitoring.
“DG AGRI must continue to communicate civil use cases to ensure future satellite configurations meet agricultural needs,” stressed a delegate from ESA.
While there is broad support for sharing IACS data, participants agreed that any data sharing must be done with farmers’ consent.
2025 ICE provided a vital space for Member States, researchers, and industry to share experiences, explore new approaches, and discuss how digital tools can better support farmers and administrations. It also reaffirmed DG AGRI’s central role as the largest civil user and buyer of very high-resolution satellite imagery in driving innovation.
“The simplification efforts made by DG AGRI with JRC support are appreciated. Now, Member States call for stability for the rest of the CAP period,” said a delegate from Poland.
As the CAP continues to evolve, ICE remains a key forum for collaboration—helping ensure that technical developments stay aligned with policy goals and the needs of the farming community.

Get your cover letter right,https://eures.europa.eu/want-improve-your-odds-getting-hired-get-your-cover-letter-right-2025-09-19_en,19 September 2025,"Nowadays, job postings usually prompt reactions from hundreds of applicants. A top-notch cover letter that stands out among many qualified candidates will put you ahead of the game.","It’s now easier than ever to apply for a job: almost all new job vacancies can be found online, and applying takes only a few clicks. While this has made things easier for both employers and jobseekers, it has significantly raised the competition level, and having a strong CV is no longer your only asset. Your cover letter should help boost your application to the top of the selection list.
In the digital recruitment age, the cover letter may sound old school, but it remains the only personalised aspect of the pre-interview process: it’s where a recruiter can ‘hear’ the real you, which might improve your chances of proceeding to the next stage. So, how can you prepare your cover letter in a way that will make you stand out from the crowd?
Familiarise yourself with the company and its values
Before you begin drafting your cover letter, find out as much as you can about the role, as well as the organisation you are applying to. Employers certainly want to see that you are suitable for the job, but they also need to know that you are a good cultural fit. Make sure this is reflected in your cover letter by showing how your particular assets and personality align with the company’s philosophy and ethos.
Keep it simple and to-the-point
Your cover letter is where you express your motivation for applying and show your suitability for the role by focusing on how your profile relates to the job description and requested qualifications. This guideline should help you stick to the relevant information only. Avoid using too many buzzwords or recruitment-speak, as this will make your cover letter one in a sea of many that follow the same formula. Keep to three or four paragraphs of text: this length should be enough to get your key points across.
One size doesn’t fit all
In the case that you are applying for multiple roles, it might be tempting to create a generalised template that will save you time. However, ensure you tailor your content to the specific position you are targeting. Bonus points for finding out who the hiring manager is and addressing them personally.
Should you enlist the help of AI?
There’s no denying it. AI has infiltrated many aspects of our lives, and it’s no use pretending that it has no role in recruitment, too. In the case of cover letter writing, AI can be either a good or a bad move, depending on how you choose to use it:

EU and Moldova extend road transport agreement,https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/eu-and-moldova-extend-road-transport-agreement-2025-09-19_en,19 September 2025,The agreement aims at helping Moldova access world markets by facilitating transit through EU countries and further developing its links with the EU market.,"The EU and Moldova decided today to extend the validity of their current road transport agreement until 31 March 2027. The agreement aims at helping Moldova access world markets by facilitating transit through EU countries and further developing its links with the EU market. This agreement with Moldova, first signed on 29 June 2022, has substantially increased exports by road from Moldova to the EU, to the benefit of both economies.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: ""We are very pleased to extend the road transport agreement with Moldova, which has already proven to be a real success for both sides. It has provided vital support to the Moldovan economy, while boosting EU exports to Moldova. This extension is a tangible demonstration of the EU’s continued support to Moldova and of the steady integration of our economies.""
The agreement was put in place following the loss of important transport routes passing through Ukraine's Black Sea ports and export markets to the east of Ukraine caused by the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. By partly liberalising road freight transport through giving transit and bilateral transport rights to Moldovan and EU hauliers for their respective territories, the agreement helps better anchoring the Moldovan market into the EU. The agreement has also strengthened the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes, by facilitating road transport between the EU and Moldova, which is an important country of transit for Ukrainian exports and imports.
Exports by road from Moldova to the EU increased by 57% in volume and 41% in value terms in the third quarter of 2024, respectively compared to the same period in 2021 (before the agreement). The EU also greatly benefited from the agreement, since EU exports by road to Moldova increased by 49% in value and 36% in volume terms from the third quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2024.
The purpose of this agreement is to temporarily facilitate road freight transport between and through the territory of the European Union and Moldova. It aims to counter the significant road transport disruptions caused by the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, by granting additional rights of transit and carriage of goods between the two markets."

The event focused on the latest fraud trends and challenges in order to strengthen the fight against tobacco fraud.
Tobacco smuggling and illicit production remains a persistent and evolving threat and continue to pose a significant challenge worldwide, depriving public budgets of billions in tax revenue and undermining public health policies. This year’s discussions focused on new routes and emerging fraud schemes.
The growing popularity of vaping products, especially among young consumers, makes it an attractive market for fraudsters. Customs agencies across the globe face significant complexity on tackling this phenomenon and agreed on strengthening their cooperation, exchange intelligence and coordinate enforcement efforts.
The event brought together over 100 stakeholders from all EU Member States and key partner countries, including Australia, China, Egypt, Norway Türkiye, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Europol and WCO also attended the event.
Salla Saastamoinen, Acting Director-General of OLAF, underlined: “Fraudsters constantly adapt to exploit new products and loopholes. Organised crime is attracted by the illicit gains that these traffics can bring. By working closely with customs and enforcement authorities worldwide, we can better protect citizens’ health, safeguard revenues and dismantle the illicit networks behind this trade, improving security in Europe.”
Samy Gardemeister, Director at Finnish Customs, added: “Customs needs to look at the entire supply chain regarding imports. In addition, in the Finnish case the port security is crucial. Non-compliant, illicit products are also produced in the EU. To counter that threat we need close cooperation with all parties and intelligence and information sharing, added by new technologies.”
The conference, now in its 28th edition, remains a cornerstone of OLAF’s strategy to foster operational cooperation, exchange intelligence and strengthen collective responses against tobacco fraud. By bringing together customs authorities, international partners and other stakeholders, it provides a unique platform to address emerging threats and reinforce the global fight against illicit tobacco."
OBSERVER: How EGNOS has revolutionised the way we fly,https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/observer-how-egnos-has-revolutionised-way-we-fly-2025-09-18_en,18 September 2025,"12 seconds—that's how long it took to make history. On 17 December 1903, two bicycle shop owners from Ohio, USA, Orville and Wilbur Wright, completed the first powered flight of a heavier-than-air aircraft. The flight covered 36 metres at a speed of just under 11 kilometres per hour and lasted only","12 seconds—that's how long it took to make history. On 17 December 1903, two bicycle shop owners from Ohio, USA, Orville and Wilbur Wright, completed the first powered flight of a heavier-than-air aircraft. The flight covered 36 metres at a speed of just under 11 kilometres per hour and lasted only 12 seconds.
Flying has come a long way since then. Over the decades, advances in technology have transformed the way we fly, making air travel safer, more efficient, and more accessible. One technological achievement that has revolutionised air travel is Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).
GNSS is key for a wide array of applications in today's modern, interconnected world. From everyday tasks such as using maps on smartphones for navigation, to more complex systems involving logistics, emergency services, and infrastructure management, satellite navigation and timing plays an important role. While GNSS such as Galileo and GPS are sufficient for daily commuting, aircraft pilots need a higher level of accuracy, precision, and above all, confidence in the reliability of the signals, known as integrity, to get themselves and their passengers to their destination safely. Enter EGNOS, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service.
In today's Observer, we'll explore how EGNOS works and how it has revolutionised the way we fly.
EGNOS is Europe's regional satellite-based augmentation system. It improves the performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in Europe and some neighbouring regions and benefits users in many sectors: from captains on board ships, to farmers using their tractors, to pilots landing their planes.
Simply put, EGNOS is a system that improves the accuracy, and more importantly, the integrity of GPS navigation data. At the moment, EGNOS only works with GPS signals, but the upcoming version (EGNOS v3) will also include Galileo support.
Normally, a person's position can be determined using GPS signals from four of the more than 30 GPS satellites currently orbiting Earth. However, GPS receivers, such as those found in smartphones, typically have an accuracy of about five metres in open areas. EGNOS improves this accuracy, allowing receivers to pinpoint locations to within one to two metres.
EGNOS accomplishes this improved accuracy with the help of more than 40 ground stations across Europe that receive GPS signals and forward them to control centres. These centres analyse the data to detect errors in the GPS signals, such as satellite clock errors, ephemeris, and ionospheric delays, and generate correction and integrity information. This information is then sent to uplink stations, which transmit it to geostationary satellites carrying EGNOS payloads. These satellites then relay the corrected signals back to EGNOS-enabled GPS receivers on Earth, combining the corrected GPS signals with the integrity messages to provide users with not only more accurate positions but also crucial assurance on the trustworthiness of those signals. EGNOS also delivers a highly accurate time reference, further supporting critical applications.
Through an array of services, EGNOS provides data corrections to many different types of users: the Open Service (OS) for public applications, the EGNOS Data Access Service (EDAS) for professional and commercial access, and the EGNOS Safety of Life (SoL) Service for safety-critical operations. EDAS and OS support day-to-day activities such as personal navigation, surveying, tracking goods, and precision farming. Moreover, the EGNOS Safety of Life Assisted Service for Maritime users (ESMAS) offers tailored support for maritime navigation, while the SoL service remains central for civil aviation, supporting landing procedures such as LPV-200 for precision aircraft approaches, and is also intended for future applications in maritime, rail, and road transport.
The LPV-200 service, in particular, has become a game-changer for aviation by enabling landings equivalent to Category I Instrument Landing System (CAT I ILS) procedures, which allow pilots to land with limited visibility down to a decision height of 200 feet (about 60 metres), but without the costly ground infrastructure.
As an aircraft approaches an airport and begins its descent towards land, pilots need to know their precise position relative to the runway.
The Instrument Landing System (ILS) is a traditional ground-based radio navigation system which guides pilots during the final approach to land, providing accurate lateral and vertical guidance. It works through a combination of localiser and glideslope transmitters located around the airport. The localiser aligns the aircraft to the runway centreline, while the glideslope ensures alignment with the correct descent path.
ILS approaches are classified (Category I, II and III) based on the minimum visibility and decision height required for landing. A Category I ILS approach typically requires a decision height of 200 feet (approximately 60 metres) above the runway, at which point the pilot must decide whether to land or execute a missed approach. While ILS is widely used and known for its accuracy, it requires significant ground infrastructure, including antennas and regular maintenance. All of this is costly to install, especially at smaller or remote airports. This is where EGNOS comes in.
EGNOS LPV-200, which stands for ""Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance"" is a procedure which provides pilots with lateral and vertical guidance in a similar way to ILS. However, instead of relying on ground-based radio signals, LPV-200 uses EGNOS satellite signals. Because EGNOS improves the accuracy and reliability of GPS, it enables aircraft to follow a precise path comparable to that provided by ILS. With a decision height of 200 feet, LPV-200 enables approaches equivalent to Cat I ILS procedures.
One of the main advantages of the LPV-200 Service is that it relies on satellite technology rather than airport-specific infrastructure. This makes LPV-200 procedures more flexible and cost-effective particularly for airports that may not have the resources to install and maintain an ILS. Since its certification for use in civil aviation in 2011, EGNOS has become an important operational tool for European aviation. Today, EGNOS is used at more than 500 airports improving safety and accessibility.
These EGNOS-enabled LPV approaches are not only safer, but also more sustainable. The availability of LPV at all airports provides a greater choice of alternative landing sites, which can reduce flight distances, fuel consumption, and emissions.
Thanks to lower decision heights, pilots can more accurately assess landing conditions, often eliminating the need for circling or diverting. Minimising diversions and aborted landings significantly reduce fuel consumption, benefiting both the airline and the environment.
Although EGNOS is of great benefit to commercial flights, the system also provides crucial support to rescue operations by other aircraft types, specifically helicopters. Helicopters play an important role in rescue and Medevac (medical evacuation) operations across Europe. According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), hundreds of helicopters dedicated to emergency medical services operate throughout the European Economic Area (EEA), significantly bolstering rapid critical care and transport efforts; while exact fleet figures fluctuate, EASA’s Annual Safety Review highlights the ongoing importance of these rotary-wing aircraft in European air rescue services.
Helicopters have carried out rescues since coming into operational service in the 1950s, but poor weather or low visibility could make reaching remote sites dangerous or even impossible. EGNOS makes it possible to create satellite-guided routes for helicopters into locations like hospitals, mountain valleys, or offshore platforms. These routes provide accurate guidance for pilots, helping rescue and medevac teams reach people in need more safely, even when conditions are difficult.
EGNOS has fundamentally changed the way we navigate the skies, improving the safety, accessibility, and efficiency of aviation across Europe. As we look to the future, EGNOS v3 will augment the performance of both GPS and Galileo signals to provide even more precise and reliable navigation and extend its coverage beyond Europe, benefiting even more users."
PES Network adopts Opinion Paper on the new European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan,https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/pes-network-adopts-opinion-paper-new-european-pillar-social-rights-action-plan-2025-09-18_en,18 September 2025,"The European Network of Public Employment Services has just adopted an Opinion Paper on the new Action Plan to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, highlighting PES’ contribution to its implementation.","As the triple (green, digital, demographic) transitions, along with labour and skill shortages, are set to place new demands on labour markets, the new Action Plan presents an opportunity to take stock of progress achieved and address new challenges. The Opinion paper puts forward priority areas and possible initiatives, building on Public Employment Services’ daily experience helping jobseekers and employers navigate labour market transitions.
While the EU is close to achieving the employment target, progress on skills and poverty reduction has been uneven. The paper emphasises the need for systemic approaches to achieving all headline targets by 2030. It calls for specific objectives and actions to support groups underrepresented on the labour market, combined with visible monitoring and a clear framework for skills and Active Labour Market policies.
EU funds (particularly the European Social Fund Plus) are to remain instrumental in supporting the new Action Plan implementation. The Network calls for a commitment to employment and skills in the future Multi-Annual Financial Framework through dedicated funds, whilst prioritising social investment and reflecting upon welfare states’ sustainability.
The opinion paper also encourages prevention-focused approaches to address challenges early on. This includes boosting career guidance services, developing new types of job retention schemes, preventing long-term inactivity. Ensuring continued delivery of physical services and preventing digital exclusion, while grasping the opportunities provided by digital services, will also be key in this context.
Looking towards the delivery of the New Action Plan, the paper highlights the potential for strategic partnerships in key sectors in industrial policy, for anticipating shortages and needs for upskilling and reskilling. It also calls for keeping track of the new Action Plan’s implementation and for further supporting PES cooperation in this context.

These amounts will guarantee income support for EU farmers until 2034.
The CAP after 2027 proposal recognises the significant challenges facing the EU’s agricultural sector and strengthens support for farmers, including through a minimum ring-fenced funding for income support. The Commission is securing a minimum of €300 billion to support farmers, covering not only area-based direct payments but also other instruments ensuring farmers’ income support, such as investments, agri-environmental measures, and a Unity Safety Net worth €6.3 billion in case of market disturbances. This ensures stability and predictability for farmers while making EU budget spending more impactful. In addition to the minimum ring-fenced allocations, €453 billion remain available in the Partnership Plans for Member States to strengthen support for the farming sector. Member States will use those funds to complement the minimum CAP allocations for other mandatory CAP interventions such as, LEADER, innovation and knowledge sharing projects, or school schemes. They can also use these funds to complement income support interventions beyond the ring-fenced amounts. The Commission will provide national recommendations to guide Member States in drawing up their plans.
The envelopes will be allocated to Member States in a way that ensures both fairness and continuity in financing agriculture and rural areas. Each country’s share is based on its 2027 allocation — the final year of the current budget framework — with funds distributed proportionally to reflect these shares.
Agriculture and rural areas stand to gain from various funding opportunities and synergies with other policy areas.
Planning the CAP together with other policies gives Member States more flexibility and helps them better address the needs of their agricultural sector and rural areas at national, regional and local level.
This forward-looking CAP combines stability with ambition, ensuring that support reaches those who need it most while preparing European agriculture for the future."
EU allocates €100m-worth of ETS allowances to help airlines buy Sustainable Aviation Fuels,https://climate.ec.europa.eu/news-other-reads/news/eu-allocates-eu100m-worth-ets-allowances-help-airlines-buy-sustainable-aviation-fuels-2025-09-17_en,17 September 2025,"On 12 September 2025, the Commission adopted a Decision on the allocation of EU ETS emission allowances to airlines for the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in 2024.","On 12 September 2025, the Commission adopted a Decision on the allocation of EU ETS emission allowances to airlines for the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in 2024. This follows calculations by Member States’ authorities for commercial airlines, and marks a key step in implementing the additional support mechanism under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to promote SAF uptake.
The latest amendment to the EU ETS Directive introduced a dedicated support system to accelerate the use of SAF by granting free EU ETS allowances for the uplift of these fuels. Starting in 2024, 20 million EU ETS allowances, worth around €1.5 billion (at an allowance price of €75), are set aside for this purpose.
For the first year of application, 2024, the support amounts to about 1.3 million allowances, worth approximately €100 million, distributed between 53 operators.
The support system covers all or part of the price difference between fossil kerosene and the eligible SAF used by individual commercial aircraft operators on their flights covered by effective carbon pricing through the EU ETS. This support comes on top of the EU ETS incentive for using of sustainable aviation fuels as operators are not required to surrender allowances for the use of these fuels – an advantage worth around €25 million in 2024. Taken together, the ETS incentive for use of SAF in 2024 amounts to around €125 million (€100 million from ETS allowances and €25 million from ETS zero rating of sustainable fuels). In addition, the EU ETS finances the Innovation Fund to support innovative clean tech projects, including in the aviation sector, to further reduce its climate impact.
By publishing ETS SAF support prices, the Commission ensures a transparent support mechanism, underlining its commitment to scaling up sustainable fuels in Europe and advancing broader EU climate objectives."

In focus: Supercharging the transition with energy storage solutions,https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/focus-supercharging-transition-energy-storage-solutions-2025-09-16_en,16 September 2025,"While renewable energy sources can’t be depleted in the same way as fossil fuels, they are ‘variable’, meaning their availability fluctuates. That’s where energy storage solutions, such as batteries, have a vital role to play.","The EU is a proud champion of renewable energy. By 2023, almost a quarter of all the energy we consumed came from renewable sources – double the share in 2010, when it sat at 12.5%. Building on this progress and to keep the momentum, in 2023, EU countries set the binding target of achieving a share of at least 42.5% renewables in the energy mix by 2030.
Harnessing the energy of abundant renewable sources like the wind, the sun and our rivers offers a sustainable and crucial alternative to burning fossil fuels – allowing us to produce our own clean, secure and affordable energy in Europe. In 2024, almost half of our electricity needs could be covered from renewables. As we decarbonise our economy, the electrification rate needs to pick up significantly, and so will demand for storage solutions.
While renewable energy sources can’t be depleted in the same way as fossil fuels, they are ‘variable’, meaning their availability fluctuates. It is therefore important that we invest in technologies that help address this. That’s where energy storage solutions, such as batteries, have a vital role to play. Technological developments and market uptake have already had a positive impact on the storage sector: the costs of battery storage are down by 93% since 2010, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Pumped storage hydropower is the largest energy storage technology globally. It works by pumping water into reservoirs when there is an electricity surplus in the grid, for example on a sunny or windy day, and releasing it to generate electricity when more energy is needed.
46 GW capacity of pumped storage hydropower is installed in the EU, amounting to almost a quarter of the total global installed capacity.
Furthermore, from 2019 to 2021, EU companies were responsible for 29% of high value hydropower inventions globally.
Although your smartphone, power bank or kitchen clock is likely to spring to mind when you think of batteries, you may be surprised to learn that consumer electronics made up only 2% of global battery deployment distribution in 2023. Meanwhile, mobility applications (such as electric vehicle batteries) and stationary energy storage systems accounted for 86% and 12% respectively. This paints a clear picture of the effect that the energy transition and electrification are having on driving global battery demand.
According to the International Energy Agency, the average global demand in the energy sector, for both electric vehicle (EV) batteries and storage applications, for a single week in 2024 exceeded the total demand for an entire year just a decade earlier. In this context, the sector reached the historical milestone of 1 TWh in battery demand in 2024.
Here in the EU, according to the quarterly report on European electricity markets, more than 620 000 new electric vehicles (EVs) were sold in the passenger car segment in the first 3 months of 2025. This marks a record high for the first quarter of any year and is 15% higher than the same quarter last year, translating into a 21% EV share in the EU passenger car market.
The global battery sector is intensely competitive. According to the 2025 report from the Commission’s Clean Energy Technology Observatory, in 2023, the EU accounted for 8% of the global Li-ion battery production capacity, contributing an estimated 90 000 direct jobs to the EU economy, up from 61 000 in 2022. This being said, the EU still relies on imports to meet 50% of its demand, with approximately 83% of global Li-ion battery production capacity situated in China in 2023.
In this respect, the EU is determined to close the gap with China and the United States and assert itself as a global leader in this key industry.
As part of these efforts, in July 2025, the Commission announced a total of €852 million in strategic investments in 6 pioneering EV battery cell manufacturing projects, in the form of grants from the Innovation Fund. This followed the Commission’s 2023 announcement to strengthen the EU's battery manufacturing capacity by allocating up to €3 billion in targeted support to incentivise investment in domestic EV battery cell manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.
The EU’s Batteries Regulation, which entered into force 2 years ago, helps ensure that Europe’s ambition on batteries does not come at an environmental cost. It contributes to the EU’s circular economy and zero pollution ambitions and strengthens our strategic autonomy on batteries.
Beyond batteries and pumped storage hydropower, the EU ranks second, after the U.S., in the number of companies developing novel energy storage technologies and leads in liquid air energy storage.
From 2019 to 2021, the EU submitted 277 invention claims, with 54% considered high value, while China submitted 5 000 claims, of which 3% were high value. Nonetheless, both regions exhibit similar levels of high value inventions.
A lack of reliable data represents a challenge in analysing emerging energy storage markets. The Commission’s European Energy Storage Inventory can help address this gap within Europe. Launched in March 2025, it is the first European-level tool of its kind, providing a real-time dashboard of energy storage levels in Europe, offering energy storage data across a full range of technologies. Why not navigate the interactive map and find out where your nearest energy storage project is located?"

Commissioner for Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas presents the Clean Transport Corridor Initiative, which seeks to accelerate the deployment of heavy-duty vehicles recharging infrastructure across key freight corridors. The initiative will start with the Scandinavian-Mediterranean and North-Sea Baltic Corridors as the first test cases.
The Clean Transport Corridor Initiative, endorsed by nine Member States along the two transport corridors, will be highlighted at a signing ceremony of a Ministerial Declaration on truck recharging infrastructure in Brussels. The declaration sets out commitments to enhance cooperation and tackle key challenges, including lengthy planning and permitting processes, limited site availability, fragmented funding, insufficient grid capacity, and delays in electricity grid access. It represents both a joint political commitment and a strategic guide for current and future policies on truck recharging infrastructure.
The European Commission will continue working with the Member States to detail the measures in a roadmap and to expand the initiative to other Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors, further supporting Europe’s transition to clean road freight transport."

Worldwide, funding cuts indicate devastating impact to humanitarian response.","The Mid-Year Update of the annual Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), published today, rings the alarm on catastrophic food insecurity in six countries or territories: Sudan, Gaza, South Sudan, Yemen, Haiti, and Mali.
The Gaza Governorate has been in famine since July, and other areas are projected to fall into famine. In Gaza, more than half a million people were facing starvation in July. In Sudan, famine was first confirmed in August 2024.
In all six countries /territories, the crisis is human-induced, as the ongoing conflicts are the main driver of acute food insecurity. Gaza, South Sudan, and Yemen also have the highest share of their populations suffering from catastrophic food insecurity (IPC Phase 5). This is the most severe level of acute food insecurity according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a multi-stakeholder initiative informing food crisis response globally.
Households in IPC Phase 5 experience an extreme lack of food even after full employment of coping capacities, and they need urgent humanitarian action to mitigate starvation and acute malnutrition and prevent widespread death.
According to the Mid-Year Update of the GRFC, some areas in South Sudan's Upper Nile state are at risk of famine due to escalating conflict and dire economic conditions.
The report presents other concerning figures about the evolution of acute food insecurity (defined by the IPC as food deprivation that threatens lives and livelihoods, regardless of the causes, context or duration) in food crisis countries:
The mid-year update report identifies three main types of shock, that, when combined with a high proportion of vulnerable populations in food crisis countries, act as the main drivers of acute food insecurity. These shocks are:
The mid-year update of the Global Report on Food Crisis 2025 relies on data from multi-partner initiatives like the Integrated food security Phase Classification (IPC), the Cadre Harmonisé (CH) and other equivalent metrics. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) plays a crucial role in contributing to the production of these data, in providing technical and advisory support to the IPC and the CH frameworks as well as in the Senior Committee responsible for its endorsement.
Additionally, the JRC’s Anomaly Hotspots of Agricultural Production (ASAP) offers real-time information feeding into IPC and CH analysis.
Launched by the European Union, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) in 2016, the Global Network against Food Crises seeks to better connect, integrate, and guide existing initiatives, partnerships, programmes and policy processes to address the root causes of food crises.
Since the launch of the first Global Report on Food Crises in 2016 initiated by the JRC, the EU’s contribution is based on close coordination among European Commission’s services (mainly the Directorates-General for International Partnerships, European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations and the JRC) and other partners.
Over the last 7 years the Global Report on Food Crisis has evolved into one of the main multi-partner initiatives under the Global Network against Food Crises and serves as its flagship publication.
The Global Report on Food Crises 2025 and its Mid-Year Update is the result of a joint, consensus-based assessment of food crisis worldwide by 16 partner organisations, coordinated by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).

The 2025 Employment and Social Developments in Europe (ESDE) report highlights that one-fifth of the working-age population, around 51 million people, are currently outside the EU labour market, with women, people aged 55–64, migrants, and persons with disabilities making up the vast majority. Facilitating access to the labour market would also contribute to reaching the EU’s 78% employment rate target for 2030. At the same time, it would improve social cohesion and support the EU’s 2030 poverty-reduction target.
In 2024, the EU created 1.8 million more jobs compared to the previous year, bringing the employment rate up to 75.8%, while the unemployment rate fell to a new historic low of 5.9%.
The Employment and Social Developments in Europe is the Commission's flagship annual report on employment and social affairs. To make the labour market more inclusive and tackle labour shortages, the Commission is pursuing a wide range of initiatives. These include the 2023 Council Recommendation on adequate minimum income, the 2024 EU Action Plan on labour and skills shortages, the 2023 Communication on Harnessing Talent in Europe’s Regions and the upcoming initiative to ensure fair, transparent, and effective labour mobility. The upcoming Action Plan for the European Pillar of Social Rights and the Quality Jobs Roadmap will strengthen these efforts and contribute to EU competitiveness.
Key insights and the latest facts and figures from the 2025 Employment and Social Developments in Europe (ESDE) report will be discussed at the conference Building the workforce of tomorrow: inclusive participation and quality jobs for a competitive Europe on 13 November 2025.

With this objective corresponds also the Commissioner’s agenda during the mission. Síkela announced a major, nearly €300 million investment package, participated in the first-ever EU-Pacific Business Forum, and met high-level representatives from Pacific partner countries. To promote mutual cooperation, he also visited a number of EU-funded projects.
Commissioner Síkela said: “The Pacific region is an important partner for the European Union, and I believe that my mission brought what is was supposed to - strengthened European presence in this strategic region and supported our long-term political and economic ties. The first-ever EU–Pacific Business Forum has shown our determination to unlock opportunities for Pacific businesses, while EU initiatives in Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea demonstrate our focus on tangible, lasting benefits. Nearly €300 million in new investments and budget support will help us advance shared priorities - resilience to climate change, digitalization, development of modern infrastructure and sustainable economic growth - ultimately improving the quality of life for people in both regions. Together in a win-win partnership, we turn those priorities into action through the Global Gateway strategy.”
The new EU-Pacific investment package
The investment package, unveiled at the EU-Pacific Business Forum in Fiji, aims to boost sustainable economic development and strengthen the resilience to climate change in the Pacific. It includes several new agreements and financial disbursements in the following strategic sectors:
During his visit in Vanuatu, the Commissioner announced the first disbursement of €5 million to develop climate-resilient agricultural systems and empower rural communities – key to food security and long-term prosperity in the country.
In Papua New Guinea (PNG), the visit also served to celebrate the country’s 50th anniversary of independence. On this occasion, the Commissioner and the Minister for National Planning, Ano Pala, signed a new EU budget support programme to enhance sustainable forest management, address climate change, improve access to clean water, and strengthen governance so that institutions can serve citizens more effectively and provide better access to justice. This comes in addition to the final €1 million disbursement under the ongoing budget support programme for good governance in PNG.
EU-Pacific Business Forum
One of the highlights of the visit was the first-ever EU-Pacific Business Forum, held in Nadi, Fiji on 4-5 September. It brought together high-level EU and Pacific policymakers, private sector leaders, investors to unlock trade and investment opportunities, showcase concrete projects, and build lasting business partnerships.
Moreover, as a direct outcome and continuity of the Forum, the EU intends to establish a bilateral EU-Pacific entity that focuses solely on commerce and trade.
The leaders during the EU-Pacific Business Forum also announced the event will be held every two years, providing a regular platform for strengthening long-term economic ties between both regions.
During his Pacific tour, Commissioner Síkela met with high-level government representatives across the Pacific to deepen political and economic cooperation.
He also visited EU-funded projects on the ground, including schools in Vanuatu being rebuilt together with UNICEF to serve as safe learning spaces for children and emergency shelters for communities, and Fiji’s first national park - the Sigatoka Sand Dunes that the EU helps preserve, while also supporting eco-tourism and community resilience in the Pacific.
The visit came ahead of the Global Gateway Forum that takes place in Brussels on 9-10 October – where representatives of the Pacific region will also participate – set to advance global connectivity in the face of geopolitical and geoeconomic challenges.

Commission launches new initiatives with industry to boost Europe's Automotive leadership,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2090,15 September 2025,"President Ursula von der Leyen chaired the third Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the European Automotive Industry, bringing together the European automotive industry, social partners, and other stakeholders in Brussels.","Today, President Ursula von der Leyen chaired the third Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the European Automotive Industry, bringing together the European automotive industry, social partners, and other stakeholders in Brussels. The meeting reaffirmed the need to act fast to implement the Automotive Action Plan. As technology transforms mobility and geopolitics reshapes global competition, there can be no business as usual.
Led by President von der Leyen, key discussions focused, amongst others, on securing Europe's leadership in electric vehicles, accelerating innovation in autonomous and connected vehicles, and strengthening European battery manufacturing industry. The Commission is safeguarding European companies against unfair competition, improving access to critical raw materials, and supporting workers through reskilling.
On innovation, Commissioners Ekaterina Zaharieva and Apostolos Tzitzikostas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with stakeholders to accelerate Automotive Research and Innovation at the EU level, aiming to position Europe as a leader in sustainable and smart mobility by 2035 and beyond. The MoU unites the 2Zero Partnership (focusing on zero-emission road transport), the CCAM Partnership (Connected, Cooperative, and Automated Mobility), and the BATT4EU Partnership (battery value chain innovation) with their key stakeholders and industry representatives to address the automotive sector's strategic needs.
The next two years are decisive to gain technological leadership in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. Enhanced cooperation and coordination of investment priorities are crucial to developing European-build software, hardware, AI models and autonomous driving ecosystems. European Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Alliance (ECAVA),  launched during the Strategic Dialogue, will serve as a forum for setting a shared industry agenda. Executive-Vice President Henna Virkkunen will convene the first meeting in late October to kick off the work.
The dialogue also allowed the European Automotive Industry, social partners and other key stakeholders to provide input on upcoming Commission initiatives, including the review of the Regulation on the CO2 emission performance standards of cars and vans, the proposal on corporate fleets, regulatory simplification for passenger cars, as well as light commercial and heavy duty vehicles. Participants reviewed the implementation of the Action Plan, launched in March 2025, and assessed progress towards a thriving European automotive industry and a successful clean mobility transition.
Background
President von der Leyen launched the Strategic Dialogue on the future of the automotive industry in January 2025 to address profound changes in the automotive sector. The European Automotive Industry faces a rapidly evolving environment with new technologies and increased competition, alongside geopolitical uncertainties. Previous dialogues with President von der Leyen took place on 30 January 2025 and on 3 March 2025.
On 5 March 2025, the Commission introduced an Action Plan building on the Strategic Dialogue, detailing concrete actions to ensure a robust and sustainable automotive sector and help unleash its innovative power. The Action Plan is the result of an inclusive and collaborative process, which involved multiple discussions and stakeholder engagement initiated through the Strategic Dialogue. The plan also drew on insights from an open public consultation on the future of the European automotive industry, as well as the work of several working groups led by Commissioners Šefčovič, Hoekstra, Séjourné, Virkkunen, Mînzatu and Tzitzikostas.

Commission accepts commitments offered by Microsoft to address competition concerns related to Teams,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2048,12 September 2025,The European Commission has accepted commitments from Microsoft to address EU competition concerns relating to its popular team collaboration platform Teams. These commitments will henceforth be legally binding under EU antitrust rules.,"The European Commission has accepted commitments from Microsoft to address EU competition concerns relating to its popular team collaboration platform Teams. These commitments will henceforth be legally binding under EU antitrust rules.
The commitments address the Commission's concerns related to the tying of Microsoft Teams to the company's popular productivity applications Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, included in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites for business customers.
Under the commitments, Microsoft will (i) make available versions of these suites without Teams and at a reduced price; (ii) allow customers with long-term licenses to switch to suites without Teams; (iii) provide interoperability for key functionalities between communication and collaboration tools that compete with Teams and certain Microsoft products; and (iv) allow customers to move their data out of Teams to facilitate the use of competing solutions.
By helping to restore fair competition, these commitments will open up the market for other providers of communication and collaboration tools in Europe.
The Commission's competition concerns
Microsoft is a global technology company offering various services, including productivity and business software, cloud computing and personal computing. Teams is a cloud-based communication and collaboration tool. It offers functionalities such as messaging, calling, video meetings and file sharing, and brings together Microsoft and third-party workplace tools and other applications.
Suppliers of business application software, including Microsoft, are increasingly distributing this software as Software-as-a-Service (‘SaaS'), meaning a software hosted on cloud infrastructure of the supplier's choice. Microsoft has a suite-centric business model combining multiple types of software in a single offering. When Teams was launched, Microsoft included it by default in Office 365 and Microsoft 365, its widely used SaaS productivity suites for business customers.
Following the opening of a formal investigation in July 2023, the Commission preliminarily found (i) that Microsoft holds a dominant position in the worldwide market for SaaS productivity applications for professional use; and that (ii) since at least April 2019, Microsoft has been tying Teams with its market-leading productivity applications, in breach of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU') and Article 54 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area (‘EEA Agreement').
The Commission preliminarily found that, by doing so, Microsoft restricted competition on the market for cloud-based communication and collaboration products, granting Teams an undue competitive advantage in terms of distribution, which was reinforced by interoperability limitations between Microsoft's productivity applications (e.g. Outlook, Word) and communication and collaboration tools that compete with Teams. The Commission had concerns that Microsoft's conduct, in addition to giving Teams an unfair advantage in entering and quickly gaining a strong position in the market, may have reinforced its dominant position in productivity software and its suites-centric model from competing suppliers of individual software.
After the opening of the investigation, in 2023 and 2024, Microsoft introduced certain changes in the way it distributes Teams. In particular, Microsoft started offering some suites without Teams. The Commission preliminarily found that these changes were insufficient to address its concerns and that more extensive changes were necessary to effectively end the anticompetitive tying practice and its effects.
The commitments
To address the Commission's concerns, Microsoft initially offered the following commitments:
Between 16 May 2025 and 16 June 2025, the Commission market tested Microsoft's commitments and consulted all interested third parties to verify whether they would remove the Commission's competition concerns. In light of the outcome of this market test, Microsoft amended the initial proposal and further committed to:
In addition, the Commission takes note that Microsoft has unilaterally decided to align its worldwide suites offers and pricing with these commitments. It has also decided to continue offering suites without Teams for frontline workers and to further reduce the price of its largest suite without Teams for frontline workers compared to the version with Teams.
The commitments offered by Microsoft will remain in force for seven years, except for the commitments related to interoperability and data portability which will remain in force for ten years. The implementation will be monitored by a monitoring trustee, who will also mediate in case of disputes between third parties and Microsoft. If a third-party concern persists, the dispute will be subject to fast-track arbitration. The monitoring trustee will report regularly to the Commission.
The Commission concluded that Microsoft's final commitments would adequately address its competition concerns over Microsoft's conduct. It therefore decided to make them legally binding on Microsoft.
Background
On 27 July 2023, following a complaint by Slack Technologies, Inc., now owned by Salesforce, Inc., the Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation to assess whether Microsoft's conduct in connection with the distribution of Teams violates EU competition rules.
Following a subsequent complaint by alfaview GmbH, on 25 June 2024 the Commission opened a second antitrust investigation. On the same day, the Commission sent a Statement of Objections informing Microsoft of its preliminary view that, since at least April 2019, the company abused its dominant position in the market for SaaS productivity applications for professional use by tying Teams to its core SaaS productivity applications.
On 16 May 2025, the Commission launched a market test on the commitments offered by Microsoft, which ran until 16 June 2025. Following the market test, both Slack Technologies, Inc. and alfaview GmbH withdrew their complaints.
Article 102 TFEU prohibits the abuse of a dominant position that may affect trade within the EU and prevent or restrict competition. The implementation of this provision is defined in Regulation 1/2003.
Article 9(1) of Regulation 1/2003 enables companies investigated by the Commission to offer commitments to meet the Commission's concerns and empowers the Commission to make such commitments binding on the companies.
Article 27(4) of Regulation 1/2003 requires that before adopting such decision, the Commission shall provide interested third parties with an opportunity to comment on the offered commitments (‘the market test').
If the market test indicates that the commitments are a satisfactory way of addressing the Commission's competition concerns, the Commission may adopt a decision making them legally binding on Microsoft. Such a decision would not conclude that there is an infringement of EU antitrust rules but would legally bind the company concerned to respect the commitments it has offered.
If the company does not honour such commitments, the Commission may impose a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover, without having to prove an infringement of EU antitrust rules, or a periodic penalty payment of 5% per day of its daily turnover for every day of non-compliance.
More information, including the full text of the commitments, will be available on the Commission's competition website, in the public case register under case numbers AT.40721 and AT.40873.
Organisations big and small across Europe and around the world rely heavily on videoconferencing, chat and collaboration tools, especially since the coronavirus pandemic. With today’s decision, we make binding for seven years or more Microsoft’s commitments to put an end to its tying practices that may be preventing rivals from effectively competing with Teams. Today’s decision therefore opens up competition in this crucial market, and ensures that businesses can freely choose the communication and collaboration product that best suits their needs.

Gender-Sensitive Communication in the Transport Sector,https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/gender-sensitive-communication-transport-sector-2025-09-12_en,12 September 2025,"By Lucía Mejía Dorantes
Ambassador for #DiversityInTransport","The transport sector has long been a male-dominated field. Across Europe, only 22% of transport workers are women (EC, 2025). But this figure masks deeper disparities:
This imbalance isn’t just a matter of fairness—it affects performance. Research consistently shows that gender-diverse and inclusive teams are more innovative, competent, and successful. Organisations that embrace diversity, ensure fair access to opportunities, and foster a sense of belonging are better positioned to thrive.
If we aim for a sustainable, inclusive future for all, communication is not optional—it’s essential. It plays a pivotal role in:
Communication is more than just exchanging information. It’s an interactive, context-driven process where meaning is co-created by at least two individuals. It takes place in a specific context. And crucially, what matters is not what we say, but what others understand.
We use language every day to exchange information through writing, speech or signs. It is also an integral part of our culture. Language reflects the individual attributes of a person together with the societal norms, roles, identities, values, and biases of his or her community. And we shall not forget that it is influenced by a particular context.
The Oxfam guide reminds us that language may also be instrumental in reinforcing or deconstructing poverty, inequality and suffering. That’s why we need to challenge ourselves when communicating messages in order to develop ideas and stories that empower communities and different groups based on respect to all in all circumstances.
According to the Council of Europe, “gender-inclusive language means speaking and writing in a way that does not exclude or discriminate against a particular sex, gender or gender identity, and does not perpetuate sexism or gender stereotypes. This includes better acknowledging those who identify outside of the gender binary.”
The previous guides are only two examples of inclusive language in English. However, every language has its own particular issues. Thereby resources have been developed to overcome stereotypes and exclusion.
No matter what communication format you use for the specific audience you target, communication goes beyond words. Non-verbal cues—such as images, colours, gestures, and even videos & music—also carry powerful messages. These forms of “analogue communication” can either reinforce or challenge stereotypes.
Gender-sensitive communication means using language and visuals that treat all genders with equal dignity, respect, and visibility. It includes:

🖼 Visuals and design: more than aesthetic choices
Do not forget that images and design elements can subtly reinforce or disrupt gender norms. Consider the following:
In the following images we find great examples that seek inclusion in transport:
Bus drivers:
The image shows diverse bus drivers in Madrid and the video explains the ways EMT in Madrid, Spain is breaking barriers for people.

Diversity in Jobs and Careers:
The image shows jobs and careers page of the OBB group that focuses con inclusion.
Sharing caring responsibilities: Escorting trips
The image showcases the way sharing caring responsibilities helps in breaking gender stereotypes.
Gender-sensitive communication isn’t just about political correctness—it’s about building a culture of equity, respect, and belonging. It is an evolving issue that needs to be built based on respect, inclusion and empowerment for all. Every word, image, and gesture contribute to the story we tell about who belongs—and who leads—in the transport sector and beyond, and how we collectively want to move forward.

Why migrant voices matter,https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/why-migrant-voices-matter-2025-09-12_en,12 September 2025,"By Muhammad Arshad Mukhtar
Ambassador for #DiversityinTransport","As a migrant from Pakistan who completed a Master’s in Transport Engineering from Rome, my journey into the European workforce was filled with challenges and revelations. One key learning that stood out to me, both academically and professionally, is the transformative power of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) — especially in sectors like transport, which are meant to serve and represent all.
Despite the specialised education I gained in one of Europe’s leading academic environments, entering the industry wasn’t seamless. There was a noticeable gap — not just in opportunities, but in how inclusivity was translated from policy papers to practical workplace integration. I came to realise that technical competence alone is not always enough; what’s needed is an industry culture that values different voices, lived experiences, and unconventional ideas.
Transport is not just about moving people and goods — it’s about connecting lives, supporting economic mobility, and ensuring accessibility for all. A transport system designed and operated by a diverse group of people is more likely to meet the needs of diverse users. For example, urban planners and engineers from different backgrounds may approach accessibility and safety differently. Someone from a migrant background might more quickly notice that signs in only one language, or apps that don't support multicultural interfaces, unintentionally exclude many users. When those voices are included at the design table, the result is better: safer, smarter, and more inclusive transport systems.
Today, technology provides powerful tools to advance DEI goals — but only when used intentionally. AI, data analytics, and intelligent transport systems can be leveraged to identify gaps in service equity, such as which neighbourhoods lack access to affordable transit, or which demographic groups are underserved. Platforms that use human-centered design, fed by feedback from a diverse user base, can build more equitable systems. Real-time crowding data in public transport can help reduce risks for women or older persons who avoid overcrowded spaces. Multi-language transport apps can serve both native and non-native users better, encouraging usage and engagement. Bias-aware AI tools can help HR teams in transport companies reduce unconscious bias in recruitment. Technology, therefore, becomes not just a tool, but a catalyst for systemic change — if those leading its development reflect the diversity of those it aims to serve.
According to Eurostat, in 2023 the employment rate for non-EU citizens aged 20–64 in Europe was 63%, compared to 76.2% for EU nationals. The unemployment rate for non-EU citizens stood at 12.2%, more than double that of EU nationals at 5.4%. These figures underscore the structural barriers that migrants face in accessing fair employment — even in high-demand sectors like transport and logistics. This underutilisation is a lost opportunity. Non-native professionals bring valuable perspectives, especially in a continent as interconnected and multicultural as Europe.
Migrants like me are not just job seekers — we are problem-solvers, system thinkers, and bridge-builders between communities and policies.
The benefits of diversity go far beyond better decision-making. Inclusive workplaces create a culture of encouragement and innovation. When non-natives see themselves represented in leadership, engineering teams, or service design, they are more likely to contribute confidently. Companies with inclusive cultures also enjoy lower employee turnover, higher collaboration and team morale, more effective problem-solving and creativity, and greater public trust, especially in sectors like transport that interact with the community daily. A notable example is Transport for London, which invested significantly in equality and inclusion programmes. This has led to better engagement from diverse employees and more inclusive service design — a model that other cities and companies can adapt.
My experience taught me that the future of transport isn’t just about smart roads or high-speed trains. It’s about smart cultures that value every voice — no matter where it comes from. As transport continues to digitalise, embracing DEI is not only ethical — it's strategic. Inclusive design results in better, more efficient systems. Diverse teams build resilience into organisations. And equitable hiring brings in talent that has long been excluded but holds the key to unlocking solutions that are as inclusive as the societies we aim to serve.
Let’s stop seeing diversity as an obligation. Let’s see it as an engine. An engine that drives smarter design, stronger communities, and systems that serve all — equitably and sustainably.

Ukraine in Motion: Inclusive Paths Ahead,https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/ukraine-motion-inclusive-paths-ahead-2025-09-12_en,12 September 2025,"By Alisa Dorokhina
Ambassador for #DiversityInTransport","Despite the challenges of war and damaged infrastructure, Ukraine's passenger transport system remains vital in 2025.  The system includes road, rail, air, water, and pipeline transport. As of 2022, the total length of roads was 169,700 km, and the length of railways was 21,700 km, making it the fourth longest railway among European Union countries. In 2024, despite active military operations, 2,176.2 million passengers were transported in Ukraine, which is a 6.8% increase from 2023. Of those passengers, 55% were transported by urban electric transport. However, the use of trolleybuses and trams is declining in favour of road transport. This is logical given the security risks; in the context of air attacks, road transport is easier because it does not stop, allowing people to continue their way to shelter. Rail transport remains essential for intercity and international travel since airspace has been closed since 2022. International train travel from Ukraine offers a safer, more convenient, inclusive, and eco-friendly option for families, including those with young children or low-mobility groups, compared to buses or private cars. Unlike buses, which often face long border queues—sometimes exceeding 12 hours due to Ukraine’s vast borders—trains offer predictable schedules and customs checks onboard, minimizing delays. Additionally, trains emit significantly less CO2 per passenger (e.g., 28g/km vs. 104g/km for cars), making them a greener choice for eco-conscious families travelling across Ukraine’s expansive geography.
The war in Ukraine has increased the need for inclusive transport due to the growing number of veterans with disabilities, estimated at over 100,000 in 2024. A significant percentage of Ukraine's population is older with reduced mobility (approximately 20% of Ukrainians are 60+ years old, or about 7 million people). This creates an urgent need for barrier-free access to transport, complicated by damaged infrastructure. To address these issues and harmonise its transport construction system standards with the European Accessibility Act, Ukraine launched the ""Without Barriers"" initiative, spearheaded by First Lady Olena Zelenska. The initiative promotes comprehensive accessibility and creates equal opportunities for travelling.
To effectively implement all barrier-free projects in Ukraine, the Barrier-Free Council was created. This advisory body assists the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in coordinating and promoting barrier-free policies, particularly ensuring equal access to services, infrastructure, and opportunities for people with disabilities, veterans, older persons, and other groups with limited mobility. To date, the Barrier-Free Council has approved 30 legislative changes, including the establishment of driving schools for people with disabilities and the implementation of new building codes. All initiatives are implemented with the support of local businesses and external donors. The Barrier-Free Movement project, for example, includes low-floor trams and buses in 12 Ukrainian cities and is partly funded by the EU through the United Nations Development Program. The European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) also supports initiatives to modernise transport hubs and create barrier-free routes. At the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London in 2023, agreements worth €800 million were signed to mobilize private investment, some of which relate to inclusive infrastructure.
As part of this initiative, Ukrainian Railways has increased the number of trains with carriages equipped for people with disabilities, as trains provide stable, spacious environments with amenities like wider aisles, accessible cabins, and toilets designed for people with disabilities. These carriages have ramps, wider doors, special fastenings for wheelchairs, and adapted toilets. Tactile navigation, call buttons for passengers with reduced mobility, special toilets, and parking spaces have been installed at key railway stations in Ukraine's cities with populations over one million, such as Kyiv, Lviv, and Odesa. An interactive map of station accessibility is available on the Ukrzaliznytsia website, aligning with the initiative's goals of digitalisation and transparency. In 2025, National Barrier-Free Week took place at railway stations in Uzhhorod and Mukachevo. Training sessions were held for Ukrainian railway staff on interacting with people with disabilities. There were also demonstrations of inclusive carriages and testing of barrier-free routes at railway stations. These efforts are important not only for creating physical access but also for providing emotional comfort to veterans and those affected by the war, whom we treat with great respect. Notably, passenger rail transport in Ukraine is owned and operated by a single company, JSC Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia), whose sole shareholder is the state.
As for local public transport in Dnipro, the first inclusive tram route with tactile navigation and adapted stops has launched to ensure accessibility for people in wheelchairs. According to Ukraine's Ministry of Development of Communities, Territories, and Infrastructure, the accessibility of public transport stops in ten regions was monitored in 2024. The results revealed that only 15% of stops comply with state building standards. However, the ministry plans to increase this figure to 25% through reconstruction in 2025. In Kyiv, 50 pedestrian crossings with lowered curbs were installed in 2024, and 30 more are planned for 2025. The Uklon taxi-service launched an ""Inclusive"" class in Kyiv, with 5% of its fleet (approximately 200 cars) adapted for passengers with disabilities. The company plans to expand to Lviv and Odesa in 2025.
Civil society organisations play a key role in promoting accessibility. For instance, Dostupno.UA, a Ukrainian NGO, monitored 200 bus stops in Kyiv, Lviv, and Dnipro in 2024. They found that 70% of the stops had high curbs. This prompted local authorities to allocate UAH 10 million in 2025 to lower the curbs. Another organisation, Fight for Right, collaborated with local administrations to provide recommendations on designing low-floor buses and trams. This led to the purchase of 20 new vehicles in Dnipro. The Active Rehabilitation Group public organisation tested transport routes for veterans in five cities with 150 participants. This helped identify 30 problematic stops included in the 2025 reconstruction plan. These initiatives reinforce government efforts by pressuring authorities to implement changes more quickly. Barrier-free transport, such as low-floor buses and trams as part of the ""Barrier-Free Movement"" project in 12 cities, allows veterans to move freely, visit rehabilitation centres, and participate in public life. For instance, an inclusive tram route in Dnipro served 5,000 passengers with disabilities in 2025, 30% of whom were veterans. This contributes to their economic activity. According to Fight for Right, 40% of disabled veterans are willing to work if accessible transport is available. The ""Without Barriers initiative as discussed earlier, supports such changes, particularly by establishing driving schools for people with disabilities. These schools opened in 2025 and help veterans acquire new skills. The absence of barriers in transport, such as accessible stops, reduces feelings of isolation and enables social inclusion. According to the Active Rehabilitation Group, 60% of veterans who tested barrier-free routes reported improved psychological health due to the ability to move around independently.
Other steps to enhance inclusiveness in Ukraine include expanding low-floor transport options, providing staff training, developing digital applications with accessible route information, monitoring compliance with building codes, and collaborating with civil society organizations. Ukrainians believe that post-war reconstruction with European support, particularly the involvement of experts, will lead to barrier-free transport. However, this requires coordination and control.
In general, the topic of inclusivity is very timely in Ukraine. For us, it is not only about wanting to participate in best practices, but also about transitioning from a Soviet mindset that ignored people with reduced mobility to a people-centered approach full of mutual respect that involves people with special needs in creating spaces that are convenient for them. These are places where they can choose their own routes, transport mode, and travel comfortably.

European Industrial Alliance on Small Modular Reactors Unveils Strategic Action Plan,https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/news/european-industrial-alliance-small-modular-reactors-unveils-strategic-action-plan-2025-09-12_en,12 September 2025,"Last week, the European Industrial Alliance on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) adopted its first Strategic Action Plan at their second General Assembly, giving an overview of its plans over the next five years to facilitate SMRs' development, demonstration, and deployment in Europe by the early 2030.","The plan provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of its planned activities over the next five years to facilitate the development, demonstration, and deployment of SMRs in Europe by the early 2030s. The timely deployment of SMRs is crucial for maintaining the competitiveness of European industry, driving the energy transition towards a carbon-neutral future by 2050, and enhancing the EU's strategic autonomy in the energy sector.
The Strategic Action Plan outlines ten specific and targeted actions to deliver over the next five years, focusing on key challenges to SMR deployment such as market demand for SMRs beyond electricity production, revitalising the supply chain, promoting R&D and skills development, unlocking financial opportunities, and simplifying regulatory frameworks. The plan also emphasises activities aimed at financing, public engagement, fuel & waste management, as well as the issues related to the safety & security as cornerstones of the SMR development in the next years. The plan is now published on the Alliance’s web page. It supports the recently endorsed IPCEI on innovative nuclear technologies, which could be instrumental among other solutions in supporting SMR development in the years to come.
The alliance, established in February 2024, brings together a broad spectrum of more than 350 SMR stakeholders, including industry leaders, researchers, and policymakers, to unite under a shared vision and joint plan for action. From an operational point of view, the European Commission, nucleareurope, and the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP) are among the key partners orchestrating the Alliance's efforts in supporting several concrete SMR projects and implementing the various actions outlined in the Strategic Action plan. A governing board steers the alliance’s work, providing strategic advice and making important decisions.
The successful implementation of the Strategic Action Plan will require strong industry and public sector commitment, in addition to collaboration among diverse stakeholders. The alliance is committed to working closely with its members, relevant Commission services and other EU institutions and international organisations to ensure the timely and successful deployment of SMRs in Europe.

"European Heritage Days: explore the past, protect our future",/news-and-media/news/european-heritage-days-explore-past-protect-our-future-2025-09-12_en,12 September 2025,This weekend’s European Heritage Days offers you a chance to take a wander around some of Europe’s finest buildings and cultural sites for free.,"This weekend’s European Heritage Days offers you a chance to take a wander around some of Europe’s finest buildings and cultural sites for free. The theme of European Heritage Days 2025 is ‘architectural heritage’. Buildings that are often closed to the public for the rest of the year will open their doors on 13 and 14 September so that you can explore the diverse architectural styles, periods, and materials that have shaped Europe’s built environment.
Everyone is invited to take part in the events happening across Europe, including guided tours, exhibitions, workshops, performances, and digital experiences. “The identity of every town, village, and city across Europe is shaped by its architecture. It gives meaning and a sense of belonging to the places we call home,"" says Glenn Micallef, Commissioner for Intergenerational Fairness, Youth, Culture and Sport.
Developed by the Council of Europe in 1989 and joined by the European Commission in 1999, European Heritage Days is an annual initiative. Each year more than 20 million visitors visit thousands of cultural sites in Europe over one weekend to understand better their shared cultural heritage and become part of preserving Europe's heritage for present and future generations.
Since 2013, more than 60 cultural sites across Europe have also been awarded the European Heritage Label. The Commission selected these sites for their symbolic value, the role they have played in European history and the activities they offer. The Royal Theatre Toone in Brussels, the Monastery of San Jerónimo de Yuste in Spain, and the ‘Three Brothers’ complex of 15th and 17th centuries buildings in Riga have all been granted the European Heritage Label, for example.
In addition to European Heritage Days, the annual European Heritage Awards / Europa Nostra Awards honour remarkable achievements, promote best practices and set new standards in the conservation and promotion of Europe's tangible and intangible heritage. In 2025, 30 winners from 24 countries will be announced at the European Heritage Awards Ceremony on 13 October in Brussels.

Have your say on the Military Mobility Package,https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/have-your-say-military-mobility-package-2025-09-11_en,11 September 2025,"The European Commission and the European External Action Service would like to ask your views on the future Military Mobility package, announced by the White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030 on 19 March 2025.","The European Commission and the European External Action Service would like to hear your views on the Military Mobility package through a call for evidence published on Have your say portal. The consultation will remain open until 09 October 2025  (midnight Brussels time). This call for evidence aims to complement the targeted stakeholder consultation launched on 12 June 2025 with a press release.  The Military Mobility package was  announced by the White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030 on 19 March 2025. The initiative emphasises the Commission’s commitment, along with that of the European External Action Service (EEAS) and of the European Defence Agency (EDA), to collaborate closely in a coordinated way with Member States to enhance military mobility through infrastructural investment and strategic legislative and non-legislative measures. The package will encompass a Joint Communication on Military Mobility, a proposal for a Regulation on Military Mobility of the European Parliament and the Council and targeted amendments of existing EU legislation to better take into account the needs of military mobility.
Since 2017, substantial progress has been achieved by Member States and through the implementation of the EU Action Plans for Military Mobility. However, despite substantial progress achieved through the two Action Plans for Military Mobility in 2018 and 2022, many barriers continue to exist. The movement of military forces within the EU is still hindered by barriers related to regulatory, infrastructures and capabilities aspects including red tape, unharmonised rules, insufficient access to critical transport infrastructure and availability of transport assets.
For the first time, the Commission proposes a legislative instrument in this area, building on the important progress made in the PESCO and European Defence Agency frameworks. In this vein, it is critical to comprehensively consult all relevant stakeholders. The findings from the consultation will serve as the evidence base for the Military Mobility package and will be key in appropriate assessment of the impacts of the proposals.
The White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030 sets a clear tasking that the “EU will adopt a Joint Communication on Military Mobility” and “the necessary legislative proposals, this year”. To this end, the European Commission and the European External Action Service will present a Military Mobility package composed of a Joint Communication and two legislative proposals: a Regulation proposal to address all remaining barriers and supporting Member States in transporting military equipment and personnel in the EU and targeted amendments of existing EU legislation to better meet military mobility needs.
The Joint Communication is a policy document outlining the EU's objective to enhance preparedness through an improved military mobility framework. It will present the initiatives of the wider package to address remaining barriers, ensuring consistency with national efforts, but also outline concrete actions and recommendations for the years to come.
The proposal for a Regulation will establish a new regulatory framework to harmonise national procedures and rules and introduce emergency measures to ensure uninterrupted military movements in Europe, while taking into account the military movement’s impact on civilian activities. The Regulation will also create an EU framework to enhance Member States' access to military mobility capabilities, identify critical infrastructures for military mobility having a European dimension, and strengthen their resilience.
The targeted amendments of existing EU legislation aim to address issues affecting military mobility. The amendments will adapt relevant transport legislation to better accommodate the specific needs of military mobility. It will also mobilise other relevant EU legislation, such as energy or customs and taxation policies, in support of military mobility. The amendments aim to ensure a whole-of-government"" approach at EU level, better reflecting military mobility needs in existing EU legislation.
DG DEFIS ensures an inclusive approach towards all stakeholders, and as part of it, a Call for Evidence has been launched launched on the Have your Say portal on 11th of September 2025 to invite the public to submit research or position papers to a dedicated mailbox DEFIS-MILITARY-MOBILITYec [dot] europa [dot] eu (DEFIS-MILITARY-MOBILITY[at]ec[dot]europa[dot]eu) before 09th of October 2025. This call for evidence complements the targeted stakeholder consultation announced on 12 June 2025.
All interested EU citizens and actors can provide comments in the Have your say portal and you can also submit written contributions. Your views will be integrated in our reflections on the military mobility package.
The European Commission and the European External Action Service aim to propose the military mobility package by the end of the year.

Commission invites comments on draft revised EU competition rules for technology transfer agreements,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2069,11 September 2025,"The European Commission has today launched a public consultation, inviting all interested parties to
comment on drafts of a revised Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation (‘TTBER') and
revised Guidelines on the application of Article 101 of the Treaty to technology transfer
agreements","The European Commission has today launched a public consultation, inviting all interested parties to comment on drafts of a revised Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation (‘TTBER') and revised Guidelines on the application of Article 101 of the Treaty to technology transfer agreements (‘Guidelines').
Technology transfer agreements are agreements by which one firm authorises another firm to use certain technology rights – such as patents, design rights or software copyrights – to produce goods or services. Because these agreements facilitate the diffusion of technology and incentivise research and development, they are often pro-competitive, but some (restrictions in these) agreements can also have negative effects on competition.
In this context, the TTBER exempts technology transfer agreements that meet certain conditions from the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements laid down in Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU'), with the aim of facilitating the diffusion of technology, strengthening the incentives for research and development, and promoting innovation. If companies design their technology transfer agreements in accordance with the conditions of the TTBER, they have legal certainty that their agreements comply with Article 101.
The Guidelines provide guidance on the application of the TTBER and on the assessment under Article 101 TFEU of technology transfer agreements that fall outside the block exemption provided by the TTBER.
The revision of the TTBER and Guidelines follows an evaluation of the current rules, which have applied since 2014. The evaluation was completed in November 2024 and the revision aims to adapt the rules to reflect recent market developments and case law by the Court of Justice of the European Union, as well as to provide additional legal certainty for companies wishing to enter into technology transfer agreements.
The main proposed changes
The main proposed changes cover several areas, including:
Next steps
Interested parties are invited to submit their comments on the draft revised TTBER and Guidelines by 23 October 2025. More information, including on how to submit comments, is available here.
The Commission will take the feedback into account when it finalises the revised rules, ahead of the expiry of the current TTBER, on 30 April 2026.
Background
Article 101(1) TFEU prohibits agreements between companies that restrict competition. However, under Article 101(3) of the TFEU, such agreements can be declared compatible with the Single Market, provided they contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefits and without eliminating competition.
In November 2024, the Commission published a Staff Working Document setting out the results of the evaluation of the current TTBER and Guidelines. The evaluation confirmed that these instruments remain useful and relevant, but it also highlighted areas for possible improvement in terms of legal certainty and the need to reflect market developments.
Following the evaluation, the Commission launched an impact assessment to gather further evidence on possible areas for improvement, including through a call for evidence and an open public consultation launched in January 2025. It also commissioned an expert report on data licensing, which has also been published today.
While the Guidelines include guidance on the competition law assessment of technology pools that concern standard-essential patents (‘SEPs'), these Guidelines are entirely separate from the recently withdrawn Commission proposal for a SEPs Regulation. That proposal pursued different objectives, namely to improve the transparency of SEP licensing and promote licensing on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
For more information
More information is available on the Commission's competition website, on the dedicated TTBER and Guidelines review webpage.
Technology licensing agreements play an important role in promoting and disseminating innovation. That is why we have a well-established framework to encourage such agreements where they are pro-competitive, and why we now want to ensure that our framework remains clear, effective and up-to date. I invite all interested parties to share their views.

She underlined the need for a more effective and humane migration management system, which will be supported by the proposal to triple funding for migration and border management in the next EU budget.
President von der Leyen announced plans to destroy the business model of smugglers, who exploit vulnerable people and put their lives at risk:
“We need a new system of sanctions specifically targeted at people smugglers and traffickers. To freeze their assets. To restrict their ability to move around. To cut off their profits. People smuggling is a horrible, criminal business, and no smuggler should be allowed to get away with it in Europe.”
President von der Leyen also stressed the importance of returning rejected asylum seekers to their home countries, with only around 20% of those who are not allowed to stay in the EU actually leaving the Union. She called for a swift agreement on the Common European Return System and the full implementation of the Migration and Asylum Pact once it starts to apply in June 2026.
President von der Leyen also reiterated the EU's commitment to Ukraine's independence and sovereignty. She called for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, emphasising that Ukraine's freedom is Europe's freedom, condemning Russia's ongoing aggression and announcing plans for a new sanctions package.
""We need to work urgently on a new solution to finance Ukraine's war effort on the basis of the immobilised Russian assets. With the cash balances associated to these Russian assets, we can provide Ukraine with a Reparations Loan. […] Ukraine will only pay back the loan once Russia pays for the reparations. The money will help Ukraine already today.""
President von der Leyen pledged to work with the European Parliament and all pro-European democratic forces to deliver for Europeans and protect the EU's values and interests."

The Communication offers recommendations and practical guidance to help EU countries identify critical entities in 11 key sectors, including energy, transport, drinking and wastewater, food, banking, and digital infrastructure. It also provides the necessary tools to ensure a structured approach as regards reporting on the outcome of risk assessments across these sectors.
The guidelines are designed to support EU countries in implementing the Critical Entities Resilience Directive, and ensure that essential services, key to societal welfare and economic activities, remain uninterrupted in the face of external threats such as natural hazards, terrorist attacks, and public health emergencies. The Directive sets the framework for EU countries to develop national strategies, conduct regular risk assessments, and identify critical entities, which in turn must take technical, security and organisational measures to enhance their resilience.
As highlighted in the European Internal Security Strategy, ProtectEU, it is essential for all EU countries to promptly transpose and correctly implement the Directive. This will reduce vulnerabilities and bolster resilience, ensuring the uninterrupted provision of essential services that are crucial to the EU's economy and society. The Commission continues to support EU countries in stepping up the protection of critical infrastructure and the resilience of critical entities in the EU."

"More than 350,000 European companies to get energy efficiency support under major EU financing initiative",https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/more-350000-european-companies-get-energy-efficiency-support-under-major-eu-financing-initiative-2025-09-11_en,11 September 2025,"More than 350,000 companies across Europe are set to make energy efficiency gains through a €17.5 billion financing initiative by the European Union.","More than 350,000 companies across Europe are set to make energy efficiency gains through a €17.5 billion financing initiative by the European Union. The energy efficiency for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) initiative, led by the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group and supported by the European Commission, seeks to help SMEs using proven energy-saving technologies to lower their energy bills and boost their resilience and competitiveness.
The €17.5 billion financing effort by the EIB Group will nearly double the current level of support during the 2025-2027 period. It will target energy efficiency and decarbonisation steps taken by SMEs and will use a combination of existing and new financial products, including debt and equity instruments.
The initiative aims to mobilise total investment of over €65 billion by 2027 for energy savings by SMEs, helping to close a market gap in Europe. The initiative was announced by EU Commissioner for Energy & Housing Dan Jørgensen and EIB Group President Nadia Calviño at a conference in Brussels today.
The Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen said
""SMEs are at the heart of Europe's economy and way of life. But they invest in energy efficiency at only half the rate of larger companies. This EIB initiative supported by the Commission will be key to close the investment gap, simplify access to financing, and accelerate the deployment of energy efficiency solutions. With more energy-efficient SMEs, we boost our economy, we benefit our climate, and we keep a healthy heartbeat in communities across Europe.""
EIB Group President Nadia Calviño said
""This is a significant step up in support to help companies cut energy costs. And because SMEs are the backbone of the EU economy, this is also an important step in enhancing Europe’s competitiveness.""
To streamline access and support for businesses, the initiative will introduce a “one-stop-shop for energy efficiency for SMEs.” This is a single-entry point that integrates the full EIB Group intermediated lending offering, simplifying engagement and accelerating implementation.
The backing by the Commission will include EU budget guarantees offered through the investment programme known as InvestEU and the LIFE environmental programme.
The Commission is also launching today a dedicated working group focused on SMEs under the European Energy Efficiency Financing Coalition, with the aim of addressing barriers and developing financing solutions adapted to the needs of small businesses across Europe.
Under the new initiative, the EIB will back dedicated investment platforms working alongside private sector partners, specifically targeting SME energy efficiency projects. Beyond financing new concrete projects, these platforms will broaden the investor base and attract crucial capital into Europe’s energy efficiency ecosystem.
Together, these measures reflect the commitment of the EIB Group and the Commission to supporting SMEs in their green transition and, by extension, to accelerating Europe’s competitiveness and decarbonisation drives under the EU’s Clean Industrial Deal and Action Plan for Affordable Energy."
The new ‘rules’ of the remote interview,https://eures.europa.eu/new-rules-remote-interview-2025-09-11_en,11 September 2025,"Virtual interviewing, once a rare practice, is now a normal part of hiring and is evolving in line with current trends. Here’s how to have a positive experience, hopefully landing the job you are after.","If you have interviewed for a job in the last five years, chances are you will have attended at least one virtual interview. The process sounds straightforward and convenient: you are sitting in the comfort of your home, there are no travel costs involved, no commuting time to factor in, and no special logistics to consider. Easy for everyone, right?
Yes and no. While the convenience aspect is certainly true, virtual interactions come with their own challenges. Technical glitches and the barriers to communication imposed by a screen are well-known; the use of AI is introducing another dimension that we’re not fully familiar with yet.
AI in remote hiring: friend or foe?
AI can be a significant ally for recruiters, especially during the initial stages of the hiring process. Algorithms save a lot of time by creating a first candidate selection, sometimes among hundreds of applicants. Used during the interview, AI can conduct intelligent screening by looking beyond background and expertise, identifying non-verbal cues that say a lot about a candidate’s personality and how they would fit in the company culture.
For candidates, AI tools can schedule interviews, answer questions on practical issues, and provide feedback in real time, helping them navigate the pre-interview stage. During the interview, AI may be less biased than human interviewers.
On the other hand, AI is – naturally – far from ‘perfect,’ and this may cost companies some good employees: suitable candidates could get filtered out before they even reach the human interaction stage, as many interfaces may not be trained to look beyond specific elements. For example, hand gestures or natural pauses in speech may be misconstrued as evidence of poor communication.
In light of these parameters, how can you give yourself the best chance at succeeding at your remote interview?
Treat it like an in-person interview
The biggest ‘secret’ in successfully handling remote interviews is probably to not treat them as such. For example, the fact that you are meeting a recruiter on camera doesn’t give you a free pass with your appearance, so take the time to dress the same way as you would if you were going to that office for a day’s work.
Furthermore, find out as much as you can about the company and the position you are applying for and take time to prepare your answers to standard interview questions. Consider also a list of questions to ask the recruiter, which will show your genuine interest in the role.
Test out your tech
There is nothing worse than being otherwise excellently prepared but then having to deal with a technical fail. To avoid this, check your internet speed and connection, and make sure your camera and microphone work. It is also a good idea to familiarise yourself with the specific platform the recruiter is using. Make a trial call with a friend or family member to test things out.
Prepare for the presence of AI
Many companies choose to employ AI for their initial round of interviews. If your first contact with the recruiter is via an AI platform, pay special attention to clear and concise communication. Rehearse beforehand to avoid awkward pauses in your speech and excessive use of filler phrases or rambling. Your tone, pace, and confidence are most important in these interactions. Acting as if you have a human recruiter in front of you will maximise your chances of passing through the AI gatekeeper and continuing to the rest of the recruitment process.

The exhibition provides a powerful visual narrative of Ukraine’s resilience in the face of war, and highlights the enduring partnership between the EU and UNDP in supporting recovery and development across the country. Through the stories and portraits of 15 Ukrainians, the exhibition captures moments of courage, perseverance, and hope.
The official opening will take place on Tuesday, 16 September at 16:00, with addresses from:
The exhibition’s visual concept draws inspiration from René Magritte’s L’état de veille (The Waking State), where glowing windows appear in the sky among drifting clouds. In the Ukrainian context, these illuminated frames evoke war-damaged buildings with shattered walls, where light continues to shine through broken windows — a symbol of life persisting amid destruction.
Since the start of the full-scale invasion, the EU and UNDP have worked together to restore essential services and rehabilitate social infrastructure in war-affected communities. The photographs on display reflect the breadth of this partnership and the strength of the Ukrainian people.
