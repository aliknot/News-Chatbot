AI has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. As the global race to harness its potential heats up, the European Commission has put forward two strategies that will help Europe stay ahead in AI industry and science respectively. The Apply AI Strategy sets out how to speed up the use of AI in key industries and the public sector. It will be used to help the EU unlock its societal benefits - from more accurate healthcare diagnoses to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of public services. The strategy also addresses some of the key challenges by To coordinate this work, the Commission is launching the Apply AI Alliance, a forum bringing together industry, the public sector, academia, social partners and civil society. Meanwhile, an AI Observatory will monitor AI trends and assess sectorial impacts. In parallel, the Commission has launched the AI Act Service Desk to help ensure smooth implementation of the AI Act, the world s first comprehensive AI law.

Press release - Commission launches two strategies to speed up AI uptake in European industry and science\n\nresearch activities, the EU has the biggest share of AI research players (13%, US 4%, China 1%). To accelerate the uptake of AI in science, the JRC stresses the need for shared infrastructures and open science to ensure reproducibility, wider access, and trustworthiness. While AI models are becoming more powerful and versatile, they also require significant resources for training and deployment. This makes investment in High-Performance Computing (HPC), AI Factories (ecosystems that foster innovation and collaboration) and open scientific data repositories essential to secure EU's position as a leader in AI research. A larger use of AI in science would generate new requirements for specialised expertise among researchers. The JRC assessment on skills shows the need for hybrid (multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary) teams that combine expertise in engineering, computer sciences and AI with specific domain expertise. Policies should therefore focus on attracting, developing and retaining this interdisciplinary talent to ensure that human expertise remains central to the research process. Researchers use AI to enhance search and discovery in science, leveraging its context-aware and semantic search capabilities to generate answers based on search results. The JRC report finds that scientists employ AI tools in varied fields, tasks and disciplines, from engineering to life sciences and humanities to drive real, applicable innovations.

Under Article 14(2) of the Governance Regulation, all Member States are obliged to submit their final updated NECPs by 30 June 2024, taking into account the Commission's recommendations and individual assessments. Poland submitted its draft plan and the Commission published the corresponding assessment in April 2024, including recommendations on where the country should raise its ambitions in line with EU targets for 2030. Following the non-submission of the final plan, the Commission contacted the Member State in a pre-infringement dialogue in July 2024. The Commission decided to open an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to Poland in November 2024. In March 2025, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion still in the absence of the final plan. Having failed to submit its final updated NECP, the Commission considers that Poland has not complied with its legal obligation and is referring it to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

All EU Member States are obliged to submit their national long-term strategies defining a coherent national plan and vision for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the EU's climate neutrality objective by 2050 and its commitments under the Paris Agreement by 1 January 2020, as set out under Article 15(1) of the EU Governance Regulation. In September 2022, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Poland for failure to comply with its obligation under the EU Governance Regulation. This was followed up with a reasoned opinion in November 2023. Until now, Poland has not submitted its national long-term strategy and it is the only EU Member State that has not yet done so. The Commission considers Poland as not having complied yet with its legal obligation and is therefore referring the Member State to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The Commission is working closely with Member States to facilitate the development of their Social Climate Plans and calls for their swift submission as the SCF kicks off one year before ETS2 starts operating in 2027. Two Member States (Sweden and Latvia) have formally submitted their plans to date and more than half of Member States have shared draft versions. In this process, the Commission has provided regular exchanges since 2023 through the Commission s SCF expert group on climate change policy, and issued Guidance on the Social Climate Plans and technical guidance on the application of the Do No Significant Harm principle in March 2025.\n\nCommission launches public consultation on CO2 markets and infrastructure The feedback received will inform the Commission s initiative planned for 2026. The European Commission has identified the need to considerably scale-up and invest in clean energy infrastructure and technologies, such as CO2 infrastructure and storage, as we work to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. For this reason, the Commission has today launched an open public consultation on upcoming legislation and impact assessment on CO2 markets and infrastructure in the EU. The consultation is open until 9 January 2026. The feedback received will inform the Commission s initiative planned for 2026. Amongst other things, the consultation builds on the Communication on the 2040 Climate Target and its impact assessment, which recognise the role of carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) in reducing harmful emissions from hard-to-abate sectors. Furthermore, the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy (COM/2024/62) recognises the need for a legislative initiative with a view to develop competitive markets and transportation infrastructure for CO2. The EU is committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5 C with ambitious and pragmatic intermediary targets. Achieving these targets and weaning off the EU s reliance on fossil fuels requires decisive climate action across all sectors of the economy. The Industrial carbon management strategy, through CCUS, has an important role to\n\nCommission provides new guidance to Member States on implementing Social Climate Fund The European Commission has issued new guidance to help EU Member States effectively implement the Social Climate Fund (SCF) and complete their Social Climate Plans (SCPs). The European Commission has issued new guidance to help EU Member States effectively implement the Social Climate Fund (SCF) and complete their Social Climate Plans (SCPs). Starting in 2026 and mobilising over 86 billion, the Social Climate Fund has been created to ensure the transition to a greener economy is fair and leaves no one behind and to support vulnerable households and small businesses in their efforts to switch to cleaner energy and transport. It will use the revenues from the new emissions trading system for fuel combustion in buildings, road transport and additional sectors (ETS2) to help vulnerable people, small businesses and transport users cope with the costs of the clean transition - especially in housing and transport. Today s guidance document builds on previous Commission guidance and technical assistance to Member States by setting out a series of principles for implementing the SCF. It also provides practical advice to help EU countries deliver their Social Climate Plans (necessary to access funding) and implement them effectively so that support swiftly reaches those exposed to energy or transport poverty and social fairness is guaranteed. In addition, the integration of Social Climate Plans into\n\nQuestion: What did the European Commission announce about climate policy?\nHelpful Answer: The European Commission announced that it is referring Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union for failing to submit its final updated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) and national long-term strategy in line with EU regulations. The Commission also launched a public consultation on CO2 markets and infrastructure and provided new guidance to help EU Member States effectively implement the Social Climate Fund. Additionally, the Commission mentioned the importance of the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy in reducing harmful emissions from hard-to-abate sectors and achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

When those voices are included at the design table, the result is better: safer, smarter, and more inclusive transport systems. Today, technology provides powerful tools to advance DEI goals but only when used intentionally. AI, data analytics, and intelligent transport systems can be leveraged to identify gaps in service equity, such as which neighbourhoods lack access to affordable transit, or which demographic groups are underserved. Platforms that use human-centered design, fed by feedback from a diverse user base, can build more equitable systems. Real-time crowding data in public transport can help reduce risks for women or older persons who avoid overcrowded spaces. Multi-language transport apps can serve both native and non-native users better, encouraging usage and engagement. Bias-aware AI tools can help HR teams in transport companies reduce unconscious bias in recruitment. Technology, therefore, becomes not just a tool, but a catalyst for systemic change if those leading its development reflect the diversity of those it aims to serve. According to Eurostat, in 2023 the employment rate for non-EU citizens aged 20 64 in Europe was 63%, compared to 76.2% for EU nationals.

However, under Article 101(3) of the TFEU, such agreements can be declared compatible with the Single Market, provided they contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefits and without eliminating competition. In November 2024, the Commission published a Staff Working Document setting out the results of the evaluation of the current TTBER and Guidelines. The evaluation confirmed that these instruments remain useful and relevant, but it also highlighted areas for possible improvement in terms of legal certainty and the need to reflect market developments. Following the evaluation, the Commission launched an impact assessment to gather further evidence on possible areas for improvement, including through a call for evidence and an open public consultation launched in January 2025. It also commissioned an expert report on data licensing, which has also been published today. While the Guidelines include guidance on the competition law assessment of technology pools that concern standard-essential patents ( SEPs'), these Guidelines are entirely separate from the recently withdrawn Commission proposal for a SEPs Regulation. That proposal pursued different objectives, namely to improve the transparency of SEP licensing and promote licensing on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms. For more\n\nby 2027). This increasing overcapacity, increasing imports of steel and closing of third country markets add to the internal challenges faced by the EU steel industry. These include an increase of trade-restrictive measures across third countries, high energy and manufacturing costs in the EU, and lower internal demand. These challenges unduly weaken the EU industry's competitiveness in a global market, undermining the industry's ability to invest notably in decarbonisation and threatening its long-term viability. The EU steel industry is the only major region that has lost some 65 million tonnes of capacity since 2007. In 2024, the capacity utilisation rate reached 67% [healthy rates are around 80%] and some 9,000-100,000 jobs have been lost since 2007. The sector recorded record losses in 2024. In light of these critical challenges, the Commission announced its intention to prepare a new steel measure in its Steel and Metals Action Plan (SMAP) of March 2025, with President von der Leyen reiterating the EU's commitment to protecting its steel industry in her State of the European Union (SOTEU) address. The proposed measure is based on an economic analysis, including an assessment of the potential impacts of various options, as well as insights gathered through a targeted consultation of sectoral stakeholders which took place over the summer. Many of the over 500 respondents, both across the industry (producers and users) and across EU Member States, were strongly supportive\n\ncrucial for a resilient and sustainable blue economy.
