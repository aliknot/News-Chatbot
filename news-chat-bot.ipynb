The European Commission has launched a public consultation on the upcoming revision of the EU standardisation regulation. This consultation will help shape future policy measures aimed at strengthening the European standardisation system and safeguarding Europe's leadership in developing high-quality, trusted standards. By ensuring that standards are efficient and effective, the EU can advance its green and digital ambitions while reinforcing its position as a leading global standard-setter. The revision was announced in the competitiveness compass in January 2025. Standard-setting delays have been highlighted among the key barriers identified in the single market strategy. The revision will play an important role in addressing this challenge and enhancing the effectiveness of the single market. It will also boost the EU's competitiveness by fostering innovation, enabling access to new technologies, and reinforcing the EU's influence in international standardisation. Planned for adoption in 2026, the revised regulation will make the standard-setting process faster, more responsive to policy needs, and more inclusive, especially for SMEs and startups. The Commission outlined the main priorities for the revision in its evaluation published in July 2025.

AI has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. As the global race to harness its potential heats up, the European Commission has put forward two strategies that will help Europe stay ahead in AI industry and science respectively. The Apply AI Strategy sets out how to speed up the use of AI in key industries and the public sector. It will be used to help the EU unlock its societal benefits - from more accurate healthcare diagnoses to enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of public services. The strategy also addresses some of the key challenges by To coordinate this work, the Commission is launching the Apply AI Alliance, a forum bringing together industry, the public sector, academia, social partners and civil society. Meanwhile, an AI Observatory will monitor AI trends and assess sectorial impacts. In parallel, the Commission has launched the AI Act Service Desk to help ensure smooth implementation of the AI Act, the world s first comprehensive AI law. Alongside Apply AI, the AI in Science Strategy focuses on putting the EU at the forefront of AI-driven research and scientific innovation.

JRC research shows that the most demanded AI-related roles in online job advertisements are AI\n\nand humanities to drive real, applicable innovations. This includes using AI tools to analyse proteins more efficiently in life-science research, an AI application proven particularly successful in medicine like more effective drug discovery. Drawing on deep dives into AI technology for protein structure prediction, material discovery and computational humanities, JRC report showcases how AI is accelerating innovation and strengthening EU research. Opportunities are emerging across the full scientific process, from data analysis to the generation of novel research hypotheses. By assessing their potential and impact, the report gathers invaluable insights to guide investments in crucial areas such as high-performance computing and open-science infrastructure. This research can thereby boost EU competitiveness at global leve The EU Competitiveness compass, published in January 2025, and the Clean Industrial Deal, published in February 2025, emphasise the importance of circular economy in creating a more sustainable, resilient and competitive European industrial sector, that in turn supports the EU's climate goals, while promoting more efficient technologies and job creation.

Press release - Commission launches two strategies to speed up AI uptake in European industry and science\n\nresearch activities, the EU has the biggest share of AI research players (13%, US 4%, China 1%). To accelerate the uptake of AI in science, the JRC stresses the need for shared infrastructures and open science to ensure reproducibility, wider access, and trustworthiness. While AI models are becoming more powerful and versatile, they also require significant resources for training and deployment. This makes investment in High-Performance Computing (HPC), AI Factories (ecosystems that foster innovation and collaboration) and open scientific data repositories essential to secure EU's position as a leader in AI research. A larger use of AI in science would generate new requirements for specialised expertise among researchers. The JRC assessment on skills shows the need for hybrid (multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary) teams that combine expertise in engineering, computer sciences and AI with specific domain expertise. Policies should therefore focus on attracting, developing and retaining this interdisciplinary talent to ensure that human expertise remains central to the research process. Researchers use AI to enhance search and discovery in science, leveraging its context-aware and semantic search capabilities to generate answers based on search results. The JRC report finds that scientists employ AI tools in varied fields, tasks and disciplines, from engineering to life sciences and humanities to drive real, applicable innovations.
